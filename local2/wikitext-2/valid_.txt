Homarus gammarus , known as the European lobster or common lobster , is a species of <unk> lobster from the eastern Atlantic Ocean , Mediterranean Sea and parts of the Black Sea 
 It is closely related to the American lobster , H
 americanus 
 It may grow to a length of 60 cm ( 24 in ) and a mass of 6 kilograms ( 13 lb ) , and bears a conspicuous pair of claws 
 In life , the lobsters are blue , only becoming " lobster red " on cooking 
 Mating occurs in the summer , producing eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year before hatching into <unk> larvae 
 Homarus gammarus is a highly esteemed food , and is widely caught using lobster pots , mostly around the British Isles 
Homarus gammarus is a large <unk> , with a body length up to 60 centimetres ( 24 in ) and weighing up to 5 – 6 kilograms ( 11 – 13 lb ) , although the lobsters caught in lobster pots are usually 23 – 38 cm ( 9 – 15 in ) long and weigh 0 @
@ 7 – 2 @
@ 2 kg ( 1 @
@ 5 – 4 @
@ 9 lb ) 
 Like other crustaceans , lobsters have a hard <unk> which they must shed in order to grow , in a process called <unk> ( <unk> ) 
 This may occur several times a year for young lobsters , but decreases to once every 1 – 2 years for larger animals 
Female H
 gammarus reach sexual maturity when they have grown to a carapace length of 80 – 85 millimetres ( 3 @
@ 1 – 3 @
@ 3 in ) , whereas males mature at a slightly smaller size 
 Mating typically occurs in summer between a recently <unk> female , whose shell is therefore soft , and a hard @-@ shelled male 
 The female carries the eggs for up to 12 months , depending on the temperature , attached to her <unk> 
 Females carrying eggs are said to be " <unk> " and can be found throughout the year 
The eggs hatch at night , and the larvae swim to the water surface where they drift with the ocean currents , preying on <unk> 
 This stage involves three <unk> and lasts for 15 – 35 days 
 After the third moult , the juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult , and adopts a <unk> lifestyle 
 The juveniles are rarely seen in the wild , and are poorly known , although they are known to be capable of digging extensive burrows 
 It is estimated that only 1 larva in every 20 @,@ 000 survives to the <unk> phase 
 When they reach a carapace length of 15 mm ( 0 @
@ 59 in ) , the juveniles leave their burrows and start their adult lives 
Homarus gammarus is traditionally " highly esteemed " as a <unk> and was mentioned in " The <unk> " a seventeenth century English folk song 
 It may fetch very high prices and may be sold fresh , frozen , canned or powdered 
 Both the claws and the abdomen of H
 gammarus contain " excellent " white meat , and most of the contents of the cephalothorax are edible 
 The exceptions are the <unk> mill and the " sand vein " ( gut ) 
 The price of H
 gammarus is up to three times higher than that of H
 americanus , and the European species is considered to have a better flavour 
<unk> are mostly fished using lobster pots , although lines <unk> with <unk> or <unk> sometimes succeed in tempting them out , to allow them to be caught in a net or by hand 
 In 2008 , 4 @,@ 386 t of H
 gammarus were caught across Europe and North Africa , of which 3 @,@ 462 t ( 79 % ) was caught in the British Isles ( including the Channel Islands ) 
 The minimum landing size for H
 gammarus is a carapace length of 87 mm ( 3 @
@ 4 in ) 
H
 gammarus is the type species of the genus Homarus Weber , 1795 , as determined by Direction 51 of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature 
 Prior to that direction , confusion arose because the species had been referred to by several different names , including <unk> <unk> <unk> , 1775 and Homarus vulgaris H
 Milne @-@ Edwards , 1837 , and also because Friedrich Weber 's description of the genus had been overlooked until rediscovered by Mary <unk> , rendering any prior assignments of type species ( for Homarus H
 Milne @-@ Edwards , 1837 ) invalid for Homarus Weber , 1795

M @-@ 82 is a state trunkline in the Lower Peninsula in the US state of Michigan that travels between <unk> and Howard City 
 The section between <unk> and Howard City travels through <unk> and along the southern edge of <unk> National Forest 
 The current version of M @-@ 82 is actually the second in the state ; the first usage appeared in the Upper Peninsula by 1919 
 The Lower Peninsula routing has been in use since the 1920s 
 Various extensions and <unk> have shifted the terminus as far west as New Era or <unk> in the past 
M @-@ 82 begins at a junction with M @-@ 120 and B @-@ 96 west of <unk> 
 This junction is at a <unk> of county lines 
 M @-@ 120 forms the north – south <unk> – <unk> and <unk> – <unk> county lines 
 B @-@ 96 , which forms the east – west <unk> – <unk> county line runs due west of the intersection 
 M @-@ 82 exits the intersection to the east 
 The highway runs along 48th Street through rural farms into the community of <unk> 
 The road , now called Main Street , passes through the downtown area and M @-@ 82 turns south along Stewart Avenue out of town 
 The highway rounds a curve and transitions to 72nd Street running eastward through more farm land 
 As the trunkline approaches <unk> , the terrain becomes more wooded near the <unk> River 
 M @-@ 82 follows <unk> Street east to a junction with M @-@ 37 
 The two highways merge and run concurrently over the river and into downtown on State Street 
 South of downtown , M @-@ 82 turns east again , independent of M @-@ 37 , and runs along 82nd Street on the southern edge of the <unk> National Forest 
 The east end of M @-@ 82 is at exit 118 on US 131 / M @-@ 46 west of Howard City 
The Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) , as a part of its maintenance responsibilities , tracks the volume of traffic using its roadways 
 These levels are expressed in terms of a metric called average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a calculation of the traffic along a segment of road for any average day of the year 
 In 2009 , the department 's measurements indicated that a segment of M @-@ 82 west of <unk> had the peak volume for the highway at 16 @,@ <unk> vehicles daily 
 The traffic nadir was 4 @,@ <unk> vehicles east of <unk> 
 In addition , MDOT has not had any section of the highway listed on the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility 
The current M @-@ 82 dates back to 1926 
 It ran from US 31 in Hart to the northern junction of US 131 and M @-@ 46 in Howard City 
 The highway was routed through Ferry , <unk> and <unk> , replacing M @-@ 41 
 In late 1936 , M @-@ 46 was extended along the section between <unk> and Howard City , forming a M @-@ 46 / M @-@ 82 concurrency to fill a gap in the M @-@ 46 routing 
 This concurrent section became just M @-@ 46 in 1938 , <unk> M @-@ 82 back to the northern M @-@ 37 junction in <unk> 
 The highway was moved to a new alignment west of Ferry in late 1947 or early 1948 
 Instead of heading northwesterly to Hart , it was continued west to end in Shelby 
Two <unk> in 1963 and 1964 rerouted the western end of the highway again 
 This time it was realigned to run from <unk> to New Era , bypassing Ferry 
 A larger change around 1969 <unk> the highway designations in <unk> County 
 M @-@ 20 replaced M @-@ 82 west of <unk> , to end at New Era instead of <unk> 
 The new M @-@ 120 designation replaced M @-@ 20 south of <unk> 
 M @-@ 82 now ran from <unk> to <unk> only 
 The length of the highway was increased in 1973 when the eastern end was moved back to Howard City 
 M @-@ 46 was rerouted to follow the US 131 freeway south of Howard City to Cedar Springs , and replaced M @-@ 57 between Cedar Springs and <unk> 
 This freed up the <unk> to Howard City highway for a return to the M @-@ 82 designation 
 The last change came in 1978 when the concurrency with M @-@ 120 was eliminated in favor of M @-@ 120 
 The M @-@ 82 designation was truncated at this time to the junction west of <unk> , resulting in the current highway routing

 Between 1890 and 1930 , Meridian was the largest city in Mississippi and a leading center for manufacturing in the South 
 Many of the city 's historic buildings were built during and just after this era , including the Grand Opera House in 1890 , the <unk> School in 1894 , two Carnegie libraries in 1913 , and the <unk> Building , Meridian 's tallest skyscraper , in 1929 
The city continued to grow thanks to a commission government 's efforts to bring in 90 new industrial plants in 1913 and a booming automobile industry in the 1920s 
 Even through the stock market crash of 1929 and the following Great Depression , the city continued to attract new businesses 
 With <unk> becoming popular in the culture during the depth of the Depression , the S
 H
 Kress & Co
 building , built to " provide luxury to the common man , " opened in downtown Meridian , as did the Temple Theater , which was used as a movie house 
 The federal <unk> was built in 1933 as a <unk> project 
During the American Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s , Meridian was home to a Council of <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) office and several other activist organizations 
 James <unk> and other local residents , along with Michael <unk> , his wife Rita , and Andrew Goodman , volunteers from the North , worked to create a community center , holding classes to help prepare African Americans in the area to regain the power to vote 
 Whites in the area resented the activism , and racial tension often resulted in violence 
 In June 1964 , <unk> , <unk> , and Goodman went to <unk> County , Mississippi , to meet with members of a black church that had been bombed and burned 
 The three disappeared that night on their way back to Meridian 
 Following a massive FBI investigation , their murdered bodies were found two months later , buried in an earthen dam 
Seven <unk> , including a deputy sheriff , were convicted in the federal <unk> in Meridian of " <unk> the victims of their civil rights " and three were acquitted in the Mississippi civil rights workers murders trial 
 It was the first time that a white jury had convicted " a white official in a civil rights killing 
 " In 2005 , the case was reopened by the state , which brought charges in the case for the first time 
 Edgar Ray <unk> was convicted of <unk> and sentenced to 60 years in prison 
 Meridian later honored <unk> by renaming a portion of 49th Avenue after him and holding an annual memorial service 
After ownership of the Meridian Main Street was transferred to the Alliance for Downtown Meridian in late 2007 , the two organizations , along with the Meridian Downtown Association , spearheaded the downtown <unk> effort 
 The Alliance serves as an umbrella organization , allowing the other two organizations to use the its support staff and housing , and in turn the Alliance serves as a liaison between the organizations 
 Plans were underway to renovate the <unk> Building , but newly elected Mayor <unk> Barry killed the plans in early 2010 
 Today , the Alliance helps to promote further development and restoration downtown ; its goal is to assist businesses such as specialty shops , restaurants , and bars because these help downtown become more active during the day and at night 
 The Meridian Downtown Association is primarily focused on increasing foot traffic downtown by organizing special events , and the Meridian Main Street program supports existing businesses downtown 
Given Meridian 's site as a railroad junction , its travelers have attracted the development of many hotels 
 Even before Meridian reached its " Golden Age , " several large hotels , including the Great Southern and the Grand Avenue hotels , were built before the start of the 20th century 
 With the growth of the railroads and the construction of the original Union Station in 1906 , many hotels were constructed for passengers and workers 
 The <unk> Hotel was constructed in 1905 , and the Terminal Hotel was constructed in 1910 
 Hotel Meridian was constructed in 1907 , and Union Hotel was built in 1908 
 Union Hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 , and both Hotel Meridian and Grand Avenue Hotel were listed as contributing properties to the Meridian Urban Center Historic District

Papa <unk> is one of the Shetland Islands in Scotland , with a population of under twenty people , some of whom immigrated after an appeal for residents in the 1970s 
 Located to the west of mainland Shetland and with an area of <unk> hectares ( 3 @
@ 2 square miles ) , Papa <unk> is the eighth largest island in Shetland 
 <unk> of the soft volcanic rocks by the sea has created an extraordinary variety of caves , <unk> , arches , <unk> , and cliffs 
 The island and its surrounding seas harbour diverse populations of wildlife 
 The west side of the island is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and the seas around the island are a Special Area of Conservation 
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> guard the harbour entrance to the south 
 The former is a <unk> island and was a <unk> colony until the 18th century ( although it has been suggested that many of the " <unk> " there were suffering from a <unk> <unk> rather than <unk> ) 
 The latter 's name relates to a story from the 14th century 
 Lord <unk> <unk> is said to have constructed the tiny house at its top , whose ruins are still visible , in order to " preserve " his daughter from men 
 Unfortunately for his plans , when she left she was found to be pregnant ; in another version of the story , she and her fisherman <unk> successfully <unk> 
 West <unk> , the inner part of which is called ' <unk> <unk> ' is the main <unk> in the north coast , the smaller <unk> <unk> lying immediately to the west 
The main settlement on the island today is <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> and is surrounded by in @-@ bye land to the east of the hill <unk> ( which runs south from West <unk> ) 
 To the west the island is <unk> by a belt of glacial <unk> about one and a half kilometres in length 
 Much of the rest of the area consists of a shallow <unk> soil that may be derived from glacial till 
 There is an almost complete absence of peat on the island and due to the volcanic rocks the soils are relatively fertile 
 The lack of peat led to ' turf <unk> ' for fuel and the bare areas of rock in the interior 
In addition to the larger <unk> mentioned above there are various other <unk> and <unk> around the coast of Papa <unk> 
 They include : <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> of <unk> , <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , The Horn , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 The <unk> <unk> lie 5 kilometres ( 3 @
@ 1 mi ) to the north west 
 They include : <unk> , North <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and The <unk> 
 In between Papa <unk> and <unk> <unk> lies the shallow bank of Papa @-@ <unk> 
The island is composed of a variety of volcanic and <unk> rock formations from the Devonian period 
 At that time the Scottish <unk> formed part of the Old Red <unk> Continent and lay some 10 @-@ 25 degrees south of the equator 
 The <unk> of Old Red <unk> , laid down from <unk> to 370 million years ago , were created as earlier <unk> rocks , <unk> by the formation of <unk> , eroded and then were deposited into river <unk> 
 The freshwater Lake <unk> existed on the edges of the eroding mountains , stretching from Shetland to the southern Moray Firth 
 The structure of Papa <unk> is largely made up of ashes and <unk> from volcanic activity associated with this period , including bands of solidified volcanic ash and <unk> ( <unk> ) , but there is also a Devonian fish bed at <unk> Banks 
 There are numerous large boulders deposited by Pleistocene <unk> 
<unk> of the soft volcanic rocks by the sea has created an extraordinary variety of caves , <unk> , arches , <unk> , cliffs , <unk> and <unk> that are amongst the finest in Britain 
 The ' Holl o <unk> ' is a cave that passes right through the north @-@ west tip of the island 
 It is nearly half a mile long and wide enough to row through 
 <unk> ( or Christie 's ) Hole in the south west is another spectacular cave , part of the roof of which collapsed in 1981 
 Yet another is ' <unk> 's Hole ' close to <unk> <unk> in the west 



 in <unk> , so exquisite is the colouring of the roof and sides and so <unk> is the water 


 [ with ] <unk> or <unk> like <unk> in a church 
Papa <unk> is the subject of a <unk> manuscript written in Old Norse , which is the oldest surviving document from Shetland 
 It deals with a dramatic incident in the house of Duke <unk> <unk> , who was later to become King <unk> V of Norway 
 There is a circle of stones near the beach at <unk> <unk> , which are the remains of a ' <unk> ' , or local assembly 
 This was the scene of a duel , fought and won by Lord <unk> <unk> , who was accused of corruption in the <unk> document and was later called ‘ <unk> de <unk> ’ 
 ( The story of his unfortunate daughter is referred to above 
 ) The remains of Duke <unk> 's thirteenth @-@ century house are still visible near <unk> <unk> 
The island church , which <unk> Kirk Sand in the bay of Fore <unk> , was founded in 1806 
 300 metres from the present church there may be an older chapel site of <unk> or <unk> on the headland between the west end of Kirk Sand and the bay of <unk> 
 It is called the ' <unk> <unk> ' by locals and referred to by the Ordnance Survey as " the site of a <unk> chapel belonging to about the twelfth century " 
 There is a tradition that the work there was <unk> with by supernatural powers and that each day 's work on the building was destroyed during the night 
 Eventually the <unk> were moved overnight by these <unk> agencies to the present site of the church and work was re @-@ commenced there successfully 
 Excavations in 2004 found little besides large blocks of <unk> and a piece of whalebone rib , suggesting that the oral tradition may have some truth to it 
In the 19th century the <unk> fishing station in West <unk> was opened and the island had a population of 360 people or more 
 However , fuel shortages and a decline in fishing due to the introduction of steam <unk> saw a fall in population from the 1870s on 
 At this time another duel entered the history of Papa <unk> 
 Edwin Lindsay , an Indian army officer and the son of the 6th Earl of <unk> , was declared insane and sent to the island in disgrace after refusing to fight in one 
 He spent 26 years as a prisoner before the Quaker preacher Catherine Watson arranged for his release in 1835 
 Lindsay 's Well is a spring at the south of the island where he was allowed to bathe 
In common with many small Scottish islands , Papa <unk> 's population peaked in the 19th century and has experienced a significant decline since then ( see e
g
 <unk> ) 
 By 1970 the island school had closed and the population had declined to sixteen ' fairly elderly ' residents , but an advertisement in Exchange and Mart reversed the decline 
 A <unk> and five sheep were offered free of charge to <unk> which brought a flood of applicants 
 By 1981 the census recorded a population of 33 
 However , by 2005 the population had fallen to 20 after serious <unk> between <unk> led to several court cases 
 A number of people left the island and the school closed 
 By early 2008 the population had dropped to just nine after a family of seven left 
 The 2011 census recorded a usually resident population of 15 - during the decade 2011 @-@ 11 Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4 % to 103 @,@ 702 
The Aberdeen trawler Ben Doran <unk> , <unk> on the <unk> <unk> 3 miles northwest of Papa <unk> , on the evening of 28 March 1930 while on her way to the village of <unk> to land her catch 
 When she grounded weather conditions were fairly good but it was not until the following day that a passing trawler saw , and reported the wreck 
 By the time that various rescue attempts were launched by the <unk> and local volunteers ( there being no lifeboat in Shetland at that time ) , weather conditions had deteriorated to the point where it was impossible to approach the <unk> 
 A request had been made for the <unk> lifeboat from Orkney , only 120 miles away , to launch , but the request was made too late to be of help 
 All 9 crew perished in the wreck 
 Only 3 bodies were recovered , that of James Mitchell , which was returned to Aberdeen , and the bodies of J
 <unk> and <unk> <unk> , which were buried in <unk> 
Papa <unk> 's most recent <unk> occurred on 9 December 1977 when the Aberdeen trawler Elinor Viking <unk> , <unk> Alec <unk> , <unk> on the <unk> <unk> 
 The <unk> <unk> came to the scene but was unable to get near enough to rescue the crew because of the sea conditions 
 At the request of Alec Webster , <unk> Station Officer , <unk> , a volunteer crew in a British Airways <unk> <unk> helicopter from <unk> Airport was <unk> 
 They managed to <unk> all the boat 's crew to safety within hours of the <unk> , despite the storm force winds 
 The helicopter crew later received a number of awards for bravery 
 There was no loss of life , but this incident prompted the building of a lighthouse on the <unk> in 1979 , and may also have been the example required for the formation of the present Search and Rescue helicopter unit , based at <unk> Airport 
<unk> is the mainstay of island life 
 <unk> form the backbone of the agricultural economy but a diversity livestock are kept , including cattle , pigs , goats , chickens , ducks and <unk> 
 <unk> are grown too , often in the shelter of circular walls , such plots being known as ' <unk> <unk> ' 
 <unk> is still conducted but on a relatively small scale 
 There is a post office at the pier , but no shop 
 <unk> electricity only came to the island at the close of the twentieth century 
 The Papa <unk> Project is a Christian supported housing service offering accommodation to men with drug and alcohol issues 
 <unk> now sail across the Sound of Papa to West <unk> on the Shetland <unk> 
 The crossing takes 45 minutes , and although the <unk> carries cars , there is only one short road on the <unk> visiting <unk> the four main <unk> provide good shelter , but the strong tides in both the Sound of Papa and to the north west require considerable care 
" <unk> <unk> <unk> ! " refers to the <unk> ' practice of rowing their open fishing boat out to sea until the high cliffs of <unk> were no longer visible 
 This entailed the boat being some 96 kilometres ( 60 mi ) west of Papa <unk> 
 The ' tide @-@ <unk> ' are increased swells of unusual size due to the combined action of wind against tide 
 The <unk> final image of the piece is of the fishermen being led back home to Papa by the ' scent o <unk> ' across the water 
 This is an example of <unk> 's ability to create a vivid sensual impression of a situation 
 An extra layer of meaning is added by the knowledge that Da Horn o Papa collapsed in a storm around the time of this poem 's composition , so that it is a tribute not just to a lost way of life , but a noted geographical feature 
When drummer Lombardo left Slayer in 1992 , the band hired a full @-@ time replacement in Forbidden drummer Paul <unk>

 The following morning , <unk> attained winds of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) as it passed roughly 15 mi ( 20 km ) of Mexico 
 Due to its interaction with land , the hurricane abruptly weakened hours later 
 Early on June 22 , <unk> dissipated over open waters 
 Prior to <unk> 's arrival in Mexico , hurricane watches and warnings were issued for coastal areas 
 Hundreds of shelters opened across the states of Colima and Guerrero 
 Heavy rains from the storm triggered significant flooding along the <unk> River in Acapulco , killing four people 
 However , the overall effects of <unk> were limited and the rains were largely beneficial in <unk> a severe drought 
On June 16 , 2011 , a trough situated off the southern coast of Guatemala showed signs of possible tropical cyclogenesis 
 Though located within an area favoring development , the system remained broad and disorganized as it moved slowly west @-@ northwestward 
 Gradually , convection consolidated around an area of low pressure 
 On June 18 , a Tropical Cyclone Formation <unk> was issued for the system as it was expected to develop into a tropical depression within 24 hours 
 On the following day , the low further developed and was declared Tropical Depression Two @-@ E by the National Hurricane Center at 1500 UTC

 In response to quick degradation of the system 's structure , the NHC downgraded <unk> to a tropical storm 
 Rapid weakening continued throughout the day and by the evening hours , the storm no longer had a defined circulation 
 Lacking an organized center and deep convection , the final advisory was issued on <unk>

 Elsewhere , the song was a top ten hit 
 However , in the United States , the song did not perform well due to an <unk> on radio but was able to reach the top of Billboard 's dance charts and became one of the decade 's most successful dance hits 
" <unk> " was one of the first tracks developed for Confessions on a Dance <unk> , along with " <unk> Up " and " Future Lovers " 
 It was also the one which took the most time to finish because Madonna " thought it was too melodramatic and could never decide when it was right 
 " The songs were developed with a remixed perspective in mind 
 Madonna commented that , " Whenever I make records , I often like the remixes better than the original ones 
 [ 


 ] So I thought , screw that 
 I 'm going to start from that perspective " 
 She promoted the album at the dance party " <unk> " held at Luke & <unk> 's nightclub in Greenwich Village , invited by Junior <unk> to take over the DJ booth where she mixed " <unk> Up " with " <unk> "

 The song talks about personal <unk> and self @-@ <unk> , denoting a shift in focus of Madonna as an artist from her previous songs about supremacy like " Everybody " ( 1982 ) , " Vogue " ( 1990 ) or " Music " ( 2000 ) which was centered around the subject of music itself 
 Among the various remixes , the Pet Shop Boys remix incorporated Whitney Houston 's " I Wanna Dance with Somebody ( Who Loves Me ) " with a more pronounced bassline and uses a double breakdown in the introduction 
 Pet Shop Boys and Madonna had always mutually admired each other , from the time they wrote the song " Heart " ( 1988 ) for Madonna but never delivered it 
 The remix had added lyrics sung by band member Neil Tennant which subsequently appeared on their remix album <unk> Four 
 Madonna 's voice hits on the first chorus which was remixed to have a masculine synth and a serious hook 
 A breakdown happens before the fifth minute ends , leading to the entry of programmed drum sounds after which the song ends 
Jennifer <unk> of MTV News wrote that " <unk> " is the " album 's strongest track " and that it is a " Pet Shop Boys @-@ esque " song 
 <unk> went on to say that it " 


 <unk> evokes the sounds of the ' 80s @-@ era dance clubs that first <unk> her toward stardom 
 " According to a review in the BBC 's <unk> , " New single ' <unk> ' states Queen <unk> 's <unk> stance , and though the song is wrapped up in relationship sentiment , one cannot help but hear the subtext , perhaps directed at her more savage critics : ' there are more important things than hearing you speak ' 
 " Alan <unk> from BBC Music called the song " <unk> catchy " 
 Mike <unk> of The Times and Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine noted that the bassline of the song utilizes The Jacksons ' 1980 song " Can You Feel It "

<unk> Construction Corporation submitted the lowest bid and was awarded the $ 261 million contract by <unk> , the largest ever by that agency 
 The construction contract for the High Five Interchange was unique in that it contained elements not found in other construction project contracts 
 For example , it specified the concrete maturity method to be used to ensure the concrete 's strength ( the first time <unk> had ever done so ) , and contained an early completion bonus , a <unk> scale of up to $ 11 million if the company completed the contract within four years 
 Also built into the construction contract was a provision that <unk> was charged for " lane rentals " by <unk> for time they closed down traffic lanes — fees based on <unk> assessments and the time of day the lane was closed 
 The fees ranged from $ 50 to a high of $ 110 @,@ 000 for rush hours 
 In order not to interfere with traffic flow during construction , the new interchange was designed largely as elevated flyover ramps and <unk> so they could be built high over the existing junction lanes ; once traffic was transferred to the new structures the old lanes could simply be closed off and removed 
 Little of the original interchange remained when the project was finished 
During the construction , 2 @
@ 2 million cubic yards of <unk> was used , 350 @,@ 000 cubic yards of concrete was mixed on site , and 300 @,@ 000 square feet of retaining walls were built 
 Additionally , 40 @,@ 000 feet of drilled shafts and 75 @,@ 000 linear feet of drainage pipe were completed 
 In addition to the construction of 43 permanent bridges , six temporary bridges were built , resulting in 2 @

 " Tim had Hollywood good looks and the <unk> of Tom Cruise , " said his friend Dr
 Jerry Punch 
 " There he was in victory lane with the team all around him and beauty queens hanging all over him 
 It was important for the people at the hospital to see Tim the way he really was , when he was healthy and handsome and vital , not the way he was as they saw him every day in the hospital 
The secrecy surrounding the circumstance of his death caused speculation for several days

 " Punch later claimed that more than 90 drivers and personnel underwent HIV testing in the wake of Richmond 's death 
In 1990 , a few months after Richmond 's death , Washington television station <unk> @-@ TV and reporter <unk> <unk> reported that Dr
 Forest Tennant , who was then the National Football League 's drug adviser , " falsified drug tests " that ultimately helped shorten Richmond 's <unk> career 
 <unk> reported that sealed court documents and interviews showed Tennant and <unk> used " allegedly false drug @-@ test results in 1988 to bar Richmond from racing " 
 <unk> also stated that <unk> had targeted Richmond , requesting that Tennant establish a substance @-@ abuse policy with Richmond in mind 
 A series of drug tests and falsely reported positive results shortly before the 1988 <unk> 500 kept Richmond from driving in what was to have been his last big race 


 " , the report said 
 The New York Times published the findings 
 While neither Tennant nor <unk> supplied an official response at the time , <unk> did confirm that they were seeking to replace Tennant 
The <unk> County Sports Hall of Fame inducted Richmond in their second class in 1996 
 In 1998 , <unk> named Richmond one of its 50 greatest drivers of all time 
 He was inducted into the International <unk> Hall of Fame in 2002 
 The Mansfield <unk> Park <unk> Re / Max Series race in 2009 was named the Tim Richmond Memorial <unk> Re / Max 250 in honor of the area native 
 The race at Mansfield was co @-@ promoted by <unk> 's son Joseph <unk> III 
Most of the range is public land administered by the federal Bureau of Land Management 
 There is very little human development in the remote region — cattle grazing and <unk> are the primary human uses — but former mines at the <unk> <unk> produced some of the largest amounts of mercury in North America in the 20th century 
 Public lands in the mountains are open to recreation but are rarely visited 
 <unk> includes large <unk> of big sagebrush in addition to desert grasses and cottonwood and alder stands 
 Sage grouse and mountain <unk> are two bird species native to the range , and common mammals include <unk> and jackrabbits 
Despite the area 's dry climate , a few year @-@ round streams provide habitat for the rare <unk> <unk> trout 
 Fish populations in the <unk> Creek Mountains declined throughout much of the 20th century 
 In the 1980s , the effects of grazing <unk> on riparian zones and the fish led to land @-@ use conflict 
 The <unk> Creek Mountain Working Group was formed in 1988 to help resolve disagreements among livestock owners , environmentalists , government agencies , and other interested parties 
 The <unk> met and agreed on changes to land @-@ use practices , and since the early 1990s , riparian zones have begun to recover 
The range and surrounding non @-@ mountainous areas cover an area of <unk> square miles ( 2 @,@ 100 km2 ) 
 The mountains run 51 miles ( 82 km ) north to south and 36 miles ( 58 km ) east to west 
 More of the range is in Oregon ( 78 % ) than in Nevada ( 22 % ) 
 The highest point in the range is <unk> View <unk> , which is 8 @,@ <unk> feet ( 2 @,@ 593 m ) above sea level and is located in Nevada about one mile south of the Oregon border 
 About two miles southeast of <unk> View is Disaster Peak , " a large , symmetrical <unk> that is visible throughout the region 
 " At 7 @,@ <unk> feet ( 2 @,@ 372 m ) , Disaster Peak anchors the southern end of the mountains in a sub @-@ range called The <unk> 
The terrain in the <unk> Creek Mountains varies from broad , flat basins and rolling ridges to high rock <unk> cut by deep canyons 
 The canyons have steep walls with loose <unk> slopes at the <unk> 
 There are meadows around springs in the mountains , although most streams in the range do not flow year @-@ round 
 Major streams that flow off the north slopes of the mountains include ( from west to east ) <unk> Creek , <unk> Creek , <unk> Creek , and <unk> Creek 
 These streams all flow into <unk> basins in Harney County , Oregon 
 <unk> Creek and <unk> Creek are the largest of the four 
 The Kings River and <unk> Creek each drain an area on the south slopes of the <unk> Creek Mountains 
 The Kings River begins in The <unk> and flows south into Nevada , where it meets the Quinn River , which <unk> in the Black Rock Desert 
 <unk> Creek begins in Oregon a few miles north of The <unk> and flows generally east , crossing the Oregon – Nevada border five times before disappearing into the floor of the Quinn River Valley south of <unk> 
The <unk> Creek Mountains are composed mostly of basalt from a shield volcano that once stood where <unk> Mountain is today 
 <unk> thinning and the Yellowstone <unk> , which was then beneath southeastern Oregon , induced eruptions from <unk> and nearby <unk> about 17 million years ago , in the Miocene 
 The <unk> produced a series of <unk> flows that spread across the land now known as the <unk> Creek Mountains 
 <unk> from the <unk> volcano lasted for about one million years , and at least 70 separate <unk> flows occurred 
 Under the resulting basalt rock lie much older <unk> rocks that may be related to some of the <unk> age formations of the Blue Mountains in northeastern Oregon 
 Within these <unk> rocks are <unk> and <unk> <unk> bodies which were presumably <unk> during the Cretaceous Period 
The broad <unk> <unk> is a prominent geologic feature in the <unk> Creek Mountains 
 The oval @-@ shaped <unk> is a collapsed <unk> dome that <unk> the Oregon – Nevada border on the eastern side of the range and south of the Oregon Canyon Mountains 
 It is about 28 miles ( 45 km ) long and 22 miles ( 35 km ) wide 
 The <unk> dome was created by volcanic eruptions in the early Miocene 
 A total of five large ash flows were produced along with a large <unk> dome structure 
 The <unk> formed when the dome collapsed about 16 million years ago 
 The <unk> contains significant ore deposits , and mercury and uranium have been mined at eight or more sites in and around the <unk> 
 Other areas in the <unk> were mined for ores of antimony , <unk> , and lithium 
The <unk> Creek Mountains are semi @-@ arid because they are in the eastern rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west 
 When moist air from the Pacific Ocean moves eastward over the Oregon and California coastal ranges and the Cascade Range , most precipitation falls in those mountains before reaching the <unk> Creek Mountains 
 As a result , the average annual precipitation in the <unk> Creek Mountains is only 8 to 26 inches ( 200 to 660 mm ) per year , with most areas receiving between 8 and 12 inches ( 200 and 300 mm ) annually 
 Much of the annual precipitation occurs between the beginning of March and the end of June 
 Most of the rest falls as snow during the fall and winter months 
 <unk> at elevations below 6 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) usually <unk> by April ; however , at the higher elevations , snow can remain until mid @-@ June 
 Local flooding often occurs in the spring as the <unk> <unk> 
Less than one percent of the range consists of meadow wetlands and riparian <unk> ( vegetation along stream banks ) 
 However , these areas are vital to the local ecosystem 
 The meadows surround springs , which are mostly on gently sloping <unk> or in stream <unk> , and range in size from about 1 to 5 acres ( 0 @
@ 40 to 2 @
@ 02 ha ) 
 <unk> riparian <unk> follow the year @-@ round streams 
 Many <unk> areas have <unk> <unk> and <unk> groves 
 <unk> and alder groves can be found at lower elevations where terrain is <unk> and stream channels are wider 
 <unk> and rushes are also native to these stream <unk> 
 Years of heavy livestock grazing in parts of the range resulted in the loss of some grass species , riparian vegetation , and young <unk> and <unk> trees 
 Restoration of riparian areas began in the early 1970s , and plans to reduce grazing were implemented in the 1980s and early 1990s 
 However , large <unk> in southeastern Oregon during the summer of 2012 burned much of the range 's vegetation , damaging riparian ecosystems and killing hundreds of grazing cattle 
Animals in the <unk> Creek Mountains are adapted to the environment of the High Desert 
 <unk> are common in the open , sagebrush @-@ covered basins , while mule deer live in the cottonwood and <unk> groves 
 There are also <unk> sheep , cougars , and <unk> in the high country 
 Jackrabbits and coyotes are prevalent throughout the range 
 Mustangs sometimes pass through the mountains as they <unk> the Great Basin 
 Some other mammals include the northern pocket <unk> , mountain <unk> , and <unk> 's ground <unk> 
 North American <unk> live in and along streams , as do Pacific tree frogs , western <unk> toads , and <unk> snakes 
 Native bird species include the sage grouse , mountain <unk> , gray @-@ headed <unk> , black @-@ throated gray <unk> , Virginia 's <unk> , <unk> 's <unk> , pine <unk> , red <unk> , <unk> , <unk> thrush , northern <unk> , and species of <unk> and eagle 
Several streams in the <unk> Creek Mountains are home to trout , including the rare <unk> <unk> trout subspecies 
 These include <unk> Creek , <unk> Creek , Little <unk> Creek , <unk> Creek , Fifteen Mile Creek , Indian Creek , Sage Canyon Creek , Line Canyon Creek , and some tributaries of <unk> Creek 
 <unk> <unk> trout live in small , isolated populations that are often confined to individual streams , many of them in the <unk> Creek Mountains 
 These populations have significant genetic differences due to their history of isolation 
 For most of the 20th century , the trout 's numbers declined considerably 
 It was listed under federal law as an endangered species in 1970 and was reclassified as threatened in 1975 
 Reasons for the fish 's decline included habitat degradation from cattle grazing , drought , <unk> , competition with other fish , and <unk> with introduced rainbow trout , which decreased the number of genetically pure <unk> <unk> trout 
 However , reductions in cattle grazing in riparian zones since the 1980s allowed fish habitat and populations to start to recover 
The Bureau of Land Management ( <unk> ) administers most land in the <unk> Creek Mountains , but there are also some private lands and some roads in the area 
 The private lands are mainly used for <unk> along mountain streams , while the <unk> lands include large grazing <unk> for local ranchers ' cattle 
 At least 100 mining claims in the mountains have been recorded since 1892 , some of which were staked for gold exploration 
 Commercial mining has occurred in some areas , mostly near the <unk> <unk> , where uranium and large amounts of mercury have been extracted 
 <unk> in what was called the <unk> <unk> District produced 270 @,@ 000 <unk> of mercury — " the richest supply of mercury in the western hemisphere " — from <unk> extracted from the <unk> in the 20th century 
 The two leading mercury @-@ producing mines in North America were the <unk> and <unk> mines on the edge of the <unk> in Nevada 
 Together , they operated from 1933 to 1989 
 The <unk> Mine , the last mercury mine in the United States , closed three years later , in 1992 
 However , mineral exploration has continued at the <unk> Mine in the 21st century , and waste containing mercury and arsenic was returned there from the community of <unk> as part of a U
S
 Environmental Protection Agency <unk> project 
The entire mountain range is very remote ; as a result , there are few visitors , and the range offers a wilderness @-@ like experience 
 <unk> , hunting , fishing , and hiking are the most popular activities 
 The only developed recreation site nearby is at <unk> Creek Hot Springs , just south of the <unk> Ranch , where nearby there are miles of trails designated for four @-@ wheel off @-@ road vehicles 
 Hunters come to the mountains seeking trophy mule deer , <unk> , <unk> , and rabbits 
 <unk> on some streams is sometimes permitted on a catch @-@ and @-@ release basis 
 The mountains are also suitable for hiking cross @-@ country or on game trails in natural corridors along canyons and creek <unk> 
 There are more than 100 archaeological sites in the range that document use by Northern <unk> people as long as 7 @,@ 000 years ago 
By the 1970s and 1980s , a century of intense cattle grazing had reduced much of the riparian vegetation along stream banks in the <unk> Creek Mountains and elsewhere in the Great Basin 
 As a result , stream banks were eroding and upland vegetation was encroaching into riparian zones 
 <unk> populations declined as grazing cattle eliminated young trees , decreasing shade over streams and raising water temperatures 
 These conditions put the rare <unk> <unk> trout population at risk 
 Since the <unk> was officially designated as a threatened species , environmental groups began advocating the cancellation of grazing permits in the <unk> Creek Mountains 
The group eventually endorsed a grazing management plan that provided for both the ecological health of sensitive riparian areas and the economic well @-@ being of ranchers 
 In 1989 , the <unk> Ranch agreed to rest two grazing <unk> totaling 50 @,@ 000 acres ( 20 @,@ 000 ha ) to restore critical stream <unk> and mountain pastures 
 The <unk> 's <unk> on Fifteen Mile Creek was rested for three years , and its <unk> Creek pasture received a five @-@ year rest before grazing was resumed 
 In addition , the grazing season in mountain pastures was reduced from four months to two , and the total number of cattle released in the <unk> areas was reduced from 3 @,@ 800 to 2 @,@ 200 
 Finally , sensitive areas were <unk> to protect them from cattle , and additional water sources were constructed away from streams 
 Other <unk> also agreed to rest specific pastures including the <unk> Creek , <unk> Creek , and <unk> <unk> <unk> 
Mycena <unk> , commonly known as the clustered bonnet or the oak @-@ stump bonnet cap , is a species of mushroom in the family <unk> 
 The <unk> edible mushroom has a reddish @-@ brown bell @-@ shaped cap up to 4 @
@ 5 cm ( 1 @
@ 8 in ) in diameter 
 The thin stem is up to 9 cm ( 3 @
@ 5 in ) tall , whitish to yellow @-@ brown at the top but progressively becoming reddish @-@ brown towards the base in maturity , where they are covered by a yellowish mycelium that can be up to a third of the length of the stem 
 The gills are pale brown to pinkish , and the spore print is white 
 It is a widespread saprobic fungus , and has been found in Europe , North Africa , Asia , <unk> , and North America , where it grows in small groups or <unk> on fallen logs and stumps , especially of oak 
 British mycologist <unk> Corner has described two varieties of the mushroom from Borneo 
 <unk> species with which M
 <unk> may be confused include M
 galericulata and M
 <unk> 
In a molecular study of the large <unk> ribosomal DNA sequences of mycorrhizal fungi of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , M
 <unk> was found to be closely related to M
 <unk> , M
 <unk> , and M
 <unk> 
The cap is light reddish @-@ brown , with a diameter typically ranging from 1 to 4 @
@ 5 cm ( 0 @
@ 4 to 1 @
@ 8 in ) 
 Initially <unk> to bell @-@ shaped to convex , it <unk> during maturity , developing visible surface grooves corresponding to the gills underneath the cap 
 The margin of the cap has minute but distinct <unk> 
 The surface is moist and smooth , and <unk> 
 The cap frequently develops splits in the margin , or cracks in the disc ( the central part of the cap ) 
 The flesh of the cap is thick in the center but thin elsewhere , grayish to whitish , fragile , and with a slightly <unk> odor and taste 
 The gills have a <unk> attachment to the stem ( that is , running down the length of the stem ) and are a pale brownish color with <unk> of red 
 They are broad ( between 3 and 6 mm ) , and have a close to <unk> spacing , with about 26 – 35 gills reaching the stem 
 The fragile stem is 3 to 9 cm ( 1 @
@ 2 to 3 @
@ 5 in ) long by 0 @
@ 15 to 0 @
@ 4 cm ( 0 @
@ 06 to 0 @
@ 16 in ) thick and yellow to yellow @-@ brown , becoming reddish @-@ brown to orange @-@ brown in the bottom half in maturity 
 The lower portion of young stems is covered with white <unk> 
 Roughly equal in thickness at the top and bottom , the base of the stem is covered by a yellowish mycelium that can be up to a third of the length of the stem 
 The edibility of the mushroom is " doubtful " and consumption " best avoided " 
The spores are 7 – 9 by 5 – 6 @
@ 5 μm , broadly ellipsoid , smooth , and strongly amyloid ( it turns black when treated with Melzer 's reagent ) 
 The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are four @-@ spored 
 The <unk> ( cystidia on the gill face ) are not differentiated 
 The cheilocystidia ( cystidia on the gill edge ) are embedded in the gill edge and very inconspicuous , club @-@ shaped , 26 – 36 by 5 – 10 μm , and have tips that are covered with <unk> projections that can be slender or thick 
 The flesh of the gills is <unk> , and pale yellowish to dirty brown when stained in iodine 
 The flesh of the cap has a distinct <unk> , a well @-@ differentiated <unk> ( a region of tissue immediately under the <unk> ) , and a <unk> <unk> body ( gill tissue ) ; it is pale yellowish to <unk> brownish in iodine stain 
<unk> Corner defined the varieties M
 <unk> var
 <unk> and var
 <unk> in his 1994 publication on <unk> mushrooms of <unk> , a <unk> region <unk> the boundary of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 The variety <unk> ( named after its type locality , <unk> ) has a cap margin that is not <unk> , little or no odor , and cheilocystidia with shorter processes 
 It was found growing on the dead wood of <unk> <unk> , a stone oak tree in the beech family 
 Variety <unk> , found in <unk> , has spores that are almost spherical 
Mycena <unk> bears some resemblance to M
 <unk> , but is only associated with decaying hardwood logs and stumps , and is found in eastern North America , and sometimes on oak on the West Coast 
 In age , it develops reddish spots on the gills that are not seen in M
 <unk> 
 M
 <unk> is often confused with the edible M
 galericulata , a common species that is variable in cap color , size and shape 
 M
 galericulata typically has a <unk> conical cap that is dull gray @-@ brown , and white to grayish veins that have numerous cross @-@ veins 
 M
 <unk> has a <unk> stem that is bluish @-@ gray 
The fruit bodies of Mycena <unk> grow in dense groups or clusters on decaying hardwood logs and stumps ( especially oak and chestnut ) during the spring and autumn 
 The fungus forms a white , <unk> mycelium on the surface of decomposing oak leaves 
 Occasionally , it can be found growing on a living tree 
 In eastern North America , it is abundant in the area bounded by Nova Scotia , Ontario , Manitoba , Missouri , North Carolina , and New York 
 It has been found in Oregon , but the species appears to be generally rare along the Pacific Coast 
 The range of the fungus also includes Europe , the Canary Islands , North Africa , East Siberia , Japan , <unk> , Turkey , and New Zealand 
In a study of the trace metal concentrations of various mushrooms species found in <unk> ( Turkey ) , M
 <unk> was found to have comparatively high levels of iron ( 628 mg per kg ) and nickel ( 21 @
@ 6 mg / kg ) , measured on a dry weight basis 
 Laboratory studies have shown that the fungus is resistant to aluminum 
 The fungus has been investigated for its ability to <unk> synthetic <unk> that are used in the textile , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> industries 
 The <unk> are not readily biodegradable , and when discharged into the environment are persistent and many are toxic 
The oldest parts of Capel <unk> date from the first half of the 12th century 
 This was a time when many churches on Anglesey in north @-@ west Wales were first built in stone following the end of Viking raids and attempts by the <unk> to gain control of the island 
 The reason for its construction , and the saint to whom it was dedicated , are unknown 
 Geraint Jones , author of a 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey , suggests that it may originally have been a memorial chapel , or connected to a royal court nearby 
 <unk> and <unk> , authors of a 2001 guide to ancient Anglesey monuments , note that it was built in the large parish of <unk> <unk> and was perhaps intended to serving the expanding population in medieval times 
 Despite this , it seems to have remained as a chapel of ease rather than become a parish church in its own right 
 The chapel is sometimes referred to as " Hen <unk> <unk> " ( " hen " being the Welsh word for " old " and " <unk> " meaning " chapel " ) 
Capel <unk> is in the Anglesey countryside near <unk> ; the parish church of St <unk> , <unk> is about 0 @
@ 78 miles ( 1 @
@ 26 km ) away 
 Part of the churchyard wall remains , showing that it was originally within a mainly circular enclosure , as often found with early churches 
 It is cared for by Cadw , the Welsh Assembly Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales , and is open to the public 
Capel <unk> is built from rubble masonry ; at about 5 feet ( 1 @
@ 5 m ) up the walls , the style changes and smaller stones are inserted into spaces between the larger blocks , showing where the 14th @-@ century rebuilding started 
 The doorway is on the south side , headed by a plain arch , and dates from the 12th century 
 There is a stone bellcote at the west end 
 There is no structural division between the nave ( where the congregation would have sat ) and the chancel ( where the altar would have been located ) 
 There are no window openings on the north side , but there is a blocked opening to the east ( about 5 feet ( 1 @
@ 5 m ) wide ) and there are the remains of a window on the south wall 
 There is a blocked window in the south wall of the south chapel 
 The vault , which is about 27 square feet ( 2 @
@ 5 m2 ) , is reached by stone steps from inside the south chapel 
 <unk> slabs form the roof of the vault and the floor of the chapel above 
 A stone in the nave , about 2 square feet ( 0 @
@ 19 m2 ) with a hole in the top , might once have been used as a churchyard cross 
The 2011 – 12 Michigan Wolverines men 's basketball team represented the University of Michigan during the 2011 – 12 NCAA Division I men 's basketball season

Following the season , Trey Burke first said he was not inclined to enter the 2012 NBA Draft 
 A few days later , however , the realization that the pool of point guards in the 2012 draft was shallow and Burke 's stock was high led to some <unk> for him and his family : " When you have a season as a freshman like he did , the NBA , they like them young , " Trey 's father , <unk> Burke said 
 " They think their ceiling is higher when they 're young 
 Trey had 


 a solid season for a freshman 
 It 's going to be one of the weaker point guard drafts in years 
 " Some observers thought Burke was at his peak in terms of NBA potential 
 Eventually , he decided to return to play for Michigan for another year 
The team announced in September 2010 that Glenn Robinson III , son of former first overall NBA Draft pick Glenn Robinson , verbally agreed to attend Michigan , making him the first commitment in the school 's class of 2012 
 Canadian wing guard <unk> <unk> gave Michigan its second verbal commitment for the class of 2012 on March 26 , 2011 
 On November 3 , Mitch <unk> , who was ranked as the number @-@ two prospect in the nation at the time , announced his verbal commitment to Michigan 
 Within hours of the commitment , ESPN said that Michigan 's ranked as the fifth @-@ best class in the nation 
 All three signed a National <unk> of Intent with the team on November 9 
 After several other schools announced their commitments , the <unk> 's commitment moved Michigan from outside the top 25 to the seventh @-@ best class in the nation , according to ESPN 
 Michael " Spike " <unk> committed to Michigan on April 6 , 2012 
<unk> <unk> b ( abbreviated <unk> <unk> b , <unk> And b ) , occasionally designated <unk> <unk> <unk> ( to distinguish it from the red dwarf <unk> <unk> B ) , also named <unk> , is an extrasolar planet approximately 44 light @-@ years away from the Sun in the constellation of <unk> 
 The planet orbits the Solar twin star , <unk> <unk> A , approximately every five days 
 Discovered in June 1996 by Geoffrey <unk> and R
 Paul Butler , it was one of the first hot Jupiters to be discovered 
 It is also one of the first non @-@ resolved planets to be detected directly 
 <unk> <unk> b is the innermost known planet in its planetary system 
A limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect <unk> <unk> b is that only a lower limit on the mass can be found 
 In the case of <unk> <unk> b , this lower limit is 68 @
@ 7 % of the mass of Jupiter , though depending on the inclination of the orbit , the true mass may be much greater 
 However , astronomers found recently that inclination of the orbital plane is around 25 ° and the true mass may be about 1 @
@ 4 MJ 
 <unk> is not to be assumed ; the mutual inclination between c and d is 35 degrees 
The planet ( with 51 <unk> b ) was deemed a candidate for direct imaging by <unk> 
 Preliminary results from <unk> studies indicate that the planet has predominately blue color , is 1 @
@ 36 times as large and 0 @

<unk> was born in West London , England 
 He is the only child of Alan George <unk> , a literary agent , and Marcia <unk> <unk> ( née Marcia <unk> Jacobson ) , a casting agent who was involved in several films for the BBC , including The Inspector <unk> Mysteries and Walk Away and I <unk> 
 His father , who was raised in <unk> , County Down , Northern Ireland , is from " a very working @-@ class " Protestant background 
 His mother is Jewish , and was born in South Africa and raised in <unk> @-@ on @-@ Sea , Essex 
 Her family had originally come from Poland and Russia 
 <unk> 's parents had both acted as children 
As his acting career began to consume his schedule , <unk> continued his education through on @-@ set tutors 
 He admitted he was not very good at school , considering it useless and finding the work " really difficult 
 " He achieved A grades in the three <unk> @-@ level exams that he took in 2006 , but decided to take a break from education and did not go to college or university 
 Part of his reasoning was that he already knew he wanted to act and write , and that it would be difficult to have a normal college experience 
 " The <unk> , they 'd love it , " he told Details magazine in 2007 
 " If there were any parties going on , they 'd be tipped off as to where they were 
In 2000 , producer David <unk> asked <unk> to audition for the role of Harry Potter for the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the <unk> 's Stone , the best @-@ selling book by British author J
 K
 <unk> 
 <unk> had been searching for an unknown British actor to <unk> the character , and the movie 's director Chris Columbus recalled thinking , " This is what I want 
 This is Harry Potter " , after he saw a video of the young actor in David Copperfield 
 Eight months later , and after several auditions , <unk> was selected to play the part 
 <unk> also endorsed the selection saying , " I don 't think Chris Columbus could have found a better Harry 
 " <unk> 's parents originally turned down the offer , as they had been told that it would involve six films shot in Los Angeles 
 Warner Bros
 instead offered <unk> a two @-@ movie contract with shooting in the UK ; <unk> was unsure at the time if he would do any more than that 
A year later <unk> starred in Harry Potter and the Chamber of <unk> , the second installment of the series 
 Reviewers were positive about the lead actors ' performances but had <unk> opinions on the movie as a whole 
 The 2004 release Harry Potter and the <unk> of <unk> was the third film in the series 
 <unk> 's performance was panned by New York Times journalist A
 O
 Scott , who wrote that Watson had to carry him with her performance 
 Next was Harry Potter and the <unk> of Fire in 2005 
 The film was the second @-@ highest grossing Harry Potter film at that point , and <unk> singled out the humour as being a reason for the movie 's creative success 
The future of the franchise was put into question when <unk> and his co @-@ leads Emma Watson and Rupert <unk> hesitated signing on to continue their roles for the final two episodes ; however , by March 2007 <unk> had signed for the final films , which put an end to weeks of press " speculation that he would be denied the role due to his involvement in <unk> " , in which he had performed nude on stage 
 <unk> reprised his role for the fourth time in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix ( 2007 ) 
 <unk> stated that director David <unk> and actress <unk> <unk> made Order of the Phoenix the " most fun " film in the series to work on 
 His performance earned several award nominations , and he received the 2008 National Movie Award for " Best Male Performance 
 " As his fame and the series continued , <unk> , <unk> , and Watson left <unk> of their hands , feet , and <unk> in front of <unk> 's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood 
 In July 2009 Harry Potter and the Half @-@ Blood Prince was released , the series ' sixth instalment 
 <unk> received nominations for " Best Male Performance " and " Global <unk> " at the 2010 MTV Movie Awards 
<unk> admitted that some people would never be able to separate him from the character , but also said he is " proud to be associated with this film series forever 
 " Despite positive feelings about the movies , he has no interest in doing more Harry Potter films 
 After <unk> hinted about writing an eighth book , <unk> was asked if he would do another film to which he replied : " [ It is ] very doubtful 
 I think 10 years is a long time to spend with one character 
 " Despite <unk> so much time to the series , <unk> has asserted that he did not miss out on a childhood like other child actors : " I ’ ve been given a much better perspective on life by doing Potter 
<unk> made his film debut in The <unk> of Panama , an American 2001 film based on John le <unk> 's 1996 spy novel , and a moderate commercial success 
 In 2002 he made his stage debut as a celebrity guest in a West End theatre production of The Play What I <unk> , directed by Kenneth Branagh – who also appeared with him in the second Harry Potter film 
 In 2007 he appeared in the film December Boys , an Australian family drama about four orphans that was shot in 2005 and released to theatres in mid @-@ September 2007 
 Also in 2007 , <unk> co @-@ starred with Carey <unk> in My Boy Jack , a television drama film shown on ITV on Remembrance Day 
 The film received mostly positive reviews , with several critics praising <unk> 's performance as an 18 @-@ year @-@ old who goes missing in action during a battle 
 <unk> stated , " For many people my age , the First World War is just a topic in a history book 
 But I 've always been fascinated by the subject and think it 's as relevant today as it ever was 
At age 17 , in a bid to show people he was prepared for adult roles , he performed onstage in Peter Shaffer 's play <unk> , which had not been revived since its first run in 1973 , at the Gielgud Theatre

 Between the southern terminus and I @-@ 95 , the route is a mix of freeway and four @-@ lane divided highway that runs along the Delaware River through <unk> 
 This section includes a truck @-@ restricted tunnel that was built along the river near historic houses and <unk> Cemetery 
 North of I @-@ 95 , Route 29 turns into a scenic and mostly two @-@ lane highway 
 North of the South <unk> Tunnel , it is designated the Delaware River Scenic Byway , a New Jersey Scenic Byway and National Scenic Byway , that follows the Delaware River in mostly rural sections of Mercer County and <unk> County 
 The obsolete Delaware & <unk> Canal usually stands between the river and the highway 
 Most sections of this portion of Route 29 are completely <unk> due to the tree canopy 
 Route 29 also has a spur , Route 129 , which connects Route 29 to U

 Route 1 ( US 1 ) in <unk> 
Route 29 was initially designated in 1927 to run from downtown <unk> to Newark , following present @-@ day Route 179 and US 202 between <unk> and <unk> and US 22 between <unk> and Newark 
 The route between <unk> and Frenchtown was originally Route <unk> 
 In 1953 , Route 29 was shifted to follow the alignment of Route <unk> to avoid the <unk> with the U
S
 Routes 
 Route 29 between South Warren Street in <unk> and I @-@ 95 in Ewing Township was upgraded to a four @-@ lane highway , with a portion of freeway , in the 1950s and 1960s 
 In 1995 , the southern freeway part of Route 29 between I @-@ 195 / I @-@ 295 and Route 129 in Hamilton Township was completed 
 This freeway section was linked to the rest of Route 29 by a tunnel completed in 2002 
 A realignment of Route 29 in <unk> by the 2000s made the route concurrent with the entire length of 0 @
@ 26 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 0 @
@ 42 km ) Route 165 
Route 29 begins at a modified cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 195 and Interstate 295 in Hamilton Township , and it serves as the western continuation of Interstate 195 , heading to the northwest as a six @-@ lane freeway 
 The route interchanges with Route 129 , a spur of Route 29 which connects to U
S
 Route 1 , at a partial interchange with a northbound exit and southbound entrance 
 Route 29 <unk> to four lanes past this interchange and crosses into <unk> 
 The route comes to a southbound exit and entrance for <unk> Road 
 At this point , Route 29 becomes the Delaware River Scenic Byway , a state scenic <unk> that was also designated a National Scenic Byway in 2009 
 Route 29 runs along the bank of the Delaware River and enters a truck @-@ restricted tunnel that passes by historic houses and <unk> Cemetery

 Route 29 crosses the <unk> Creek and features an interchange which provides access to South Warren Street with exits in both directions but only a northbound entrance 
 Route 29 continues to a cloverleaf interchange with <unk> Street ( County Route 653 ) , which provides access to the <unk> Street Bridge over the Delaware River 
 Riverside Avenue exits as a frontage road <unk> the northbound lanes of Route 29 before the road features a northbound exit for <unk> Avenue 
 Route 29 comes to a partial interchange with <unk> Avenue , with a northbound exit and southbound entrance , and then features a northbound exit for South <unk> Avenue 
The freeway portion of Route 29 ends at the intersection with Lee Avenue and it continues northwest along the Delaware River as a four @-@ lane divided highway 
 The route meets the southern terminus of County Route <unk> ( Sullivan Way ) 
 The median <unk> again and then <unk> as the route meets the southern terminus of Route 175 , a former alignment of Route 29 that currently serves as a frontage road 
 Route 29 crosses into Ewing Township and becomes the Daniel Bray Highway 
 It passes under the West <unk> Railroad Bridge , which carries <unk> and <unk> ’ s West <unk> Line over the Delaware River 
 Route 29 intersects Route 175 again and then comes to a complex interchange with Interstate 95 , with the ramps within the median of Route 29 , just to the east of the <unk> Falls Bridge 
Upon crossing the Delaware and <unk> Canal , Route 29 <unk> down to a two @-@ lane undivided road called River Road 
 It continues along the Delaware River , next to the Delaware and <unk> Canal , which runs between Route 29 and the river 
 The route intersects the northern terminus of Route 175 
 Farther north , Route 29 enters <unk> Township and continues into a more rural setting <unk> with trees 
 Route 29 heads to Washington Crossing State Park , where it intersects County Route <unk> , which heads east on Washington Crossing @-@ <unk> Road , and the approach to the Washington Crossing Bridge , which continues into Pennsylvania as Pennsylvania Route <unk> 
 Route 29 continues north along the Delaware River through <unk> , passing by Washington Crossing State Park 
Route 29 crosses into West <unk> Township in <unk> County 
 It enters <unk> , where Route 29 becomes a four @-@ lane divided highway 
 At the intersection of South Main Street , Route 29 becomes concurrent with Route 165 
 The route becomes an undivided highway again and meets the western terminus of County Route <unk> ( Brunswick Street ) 
 It meets Route 179 ( Bridge Street ) , where Route 165 ends and Route 29 turns west for a one @-@ block wrong @-@ way concurrency with the two @-@ lane , undivided Route 179 , lasting to the intersection of Main Street , where Route 29 turns north on Main Street 
Route 29 follows Main Street north through <unk> , crossing into Delaware Township 
 It comes to an interchange with U

 Route 202 and from southbound U
S
 Route 202 provided by way of <unk> Creek Road 
 Route 29 continues along the Delaware River and enters Stockton 
 The route intersects Bridge Street , which crosses the Delaware River on the Centre Bridge @-@ Stockton Bridge and continues into Pennsylvania as Pennsylvania Route 263 
 Shortly after that intersection , Route 29 intersects the southern terminus of County Route 523 ( Stockton @-@ Flemington Road ) 
 Route 29 crosses back into Delaware Township , where it meets the southern terminus of County Route <unk> ( <unk> @-@ Stockton Road ) 
Route 29 makes a sharp left turn and heads west along the river as a rural road , crossing into <unk> Township , where the name of the road changes from Main Street to Daniel Bray Highway 
 Here , it intersects with County Route <unk> ( <unk> @-@ <unk> Road ) 
 The route <unk> to the north and continues along the Delaware River for several miles , crossing into Frenchtown , where the route becomes <unk> Road 
 Upon entering Frenchtown , an end shield for northbound Route 29 is posted to mark the end of state maintenance , which officially ends at the Washington Street intersection , where maintenance is transferred to the county 
 Despite this , Route 29 officially continues farther north along <unk> Road to its northern terminus at Route 12 ( Bridge Street / Race Street ) , a short distance east of Route 12 ’ s western terminus at the <unk> @-@ Frenchtown Bridge 
 The southern terminus of County Route <unk> is located a block north of the northern terminus of Route 29 along Route 12 
The current route was originally legislated in 1911 as part of the Delaware River Drive , a named state highway that was proposed to run from along the Delaware River from <unk> to the New York border in <unk> Township 
 Route 29 was originally defined in 1927 to run from <unk> to Newark 
 The original route ran from downtown <unk> along State Street and <unk> Drive 
 From there , it followed its current alignment to <unk> , where it followed present @-@ day Route 179 to <unk> to present @-@ day County Route <unk> , which it followed to Woods Tavern 
 The route turned north on U
S
 Route 206 ( also designated Route 31 ) and followed that route to <unk> , where it followed U
S
 Route 22 to Newark 
 The current alignment of Route 29 from <unk> to Route 12 in Frenchtown was designated Route <unk> in 1927 
The alignment of Route 29 between <unk> and <unk> was eventually shifted to follow present @-@ day U
S
 Route 202 , which was also Route 30 ( now Route 31 ) between <unk> and Flemington and Route 12 between Flemington and <unk> 
 In 1938 , Route <unk> was planned as an extension of Route <unk> from Frenchtown to Route 28 ( now Route 122 ) in Alpha 
 While this road was never built , much of the alignment north of Milford is served by County Route <unk> 
 In 1948 , a spur route , Route <unk> , was created , running along U
S
 Route 202 ( Bridge Street ) in <unk> to the New Hope @-@ <unk> Bridge 
 In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering , Route 29 was <unk> to continue north from <unk> to Frenchtown on Route <unk> , and the Route 29 designation between <unk> and Newark was removed in favor of U
S
 Route 202 between <unk> and <unk> and U
S
 Route 22 between <unk> and Newark 
 The section of former Route 29 between Route <unk> and Route <unk> became Route 165 
Plans for a limited @-@ access route along the Route 29 corridor go back to 1932 , when a parkway was proposed along the Delaware River between <unk> and <unk> ; this proposal never materialized 
 Plans for a freeway were resurrected in the early 1950s to construct a road , the John Fitch Parkway , that was to run from Hamilton Township to Interstate 95 in Ewing Township 
 This road was built between 1954 and 1957 from South Warren Street in <unk> to present @-@ day Interstate 95 in Ewing Township 
 Construction of this portion John Fitch Parkway took up much of <unk> ’ s available waterfront along the Delaware River 
 The former alignment of Route 29 in the northern part of <unk> and in Ewing Township became Route 175 
Between 1990 and 1995 , the Route 29 freeway was built between the Interstate 195 / Interstate 295 interchange and Route 129 in Hamilton Township 
 A two @-@ lane street , <unk> Road , connected the two freeway sections 
 Plans were then made to fill the gap between the two freeway sections in <unk> 
 Construction began in 1997 on the Route 29 freeway between Route 129 and the <unk> @-@ <unk> Railroad Bridge 
 The road was to include two traffic lights at Cass Street and South Warren Street and a tunnel which was to be built as a covered roadway on the bank of the Delaware River 
 The tunnel was originally scheduled to be complete by 2001 but was delayed after the Army Corps of Engineers discovered many environmental violations that occurred with construction of the tunnel 
 The roof was put in place in October 2001 and the tunnel officially opened to traffic on March 2 , 2002 
 A restriction to trucks over 13 tons was put in place and made permanent in November 2002 
The Mongols first demanded tribute from Pagan in 1271 – 72 , as part of their drive to encircle the Song dynasty of China 
 When King <unk> refused , Emperor <unk> Khan himself sent another mission in <unk> , again demanding tribute 
 It too was rejected 
 In 1275 , the emperor ordered the <unk> government to secure the <unk> in order to block an escape path for the Song , and permitted a limited border war if Pagan contested 
 Pagan did contest but its army was driven back at the frontier by the <unk> Army in <unk> – 78 
 After a brief lull , <unk> Khan in 1281 turned his attention to Southeast Asia , demanding tribute from Pagan , the Khmer Empire , <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 When the <unk> king again refused , the emperor ordered an invasion of northern Burma 
 Two dry season campaigns ( <unk> – 85 ) later , the Mongols had occupied down to <unk> and <unk> , forcing the <unk> king to flee to Lower Burma 
 The Mongols organized northern Burma as the province of <unk> 
<unk> negotiations began in <unk> , and ended with <unk> finally agreeing to submit in June <unk> 
 The <unk> embassy , received by the emperor in Beijing in January <unk> , agreed to a treaty that acknowledged the <unk> of the Yuan dynasty or the <unk> Empire over the Pagan Empire and annual payments in taxes to the <unk> government in exchange for the evacuation of <unk> troops from northern Burma 
 But the treaty never really took effect as <unk> was assassinated in July <unk> , and no authority who could honor the treaty emerged 
 The <unk> command at <unk> now deemed the imperial order to withdraw void , and ordered an invasion of central Burma 
 They may not have reached Pagan , and even if they did , after having suffered heavy casualties , they returned to <unk> 
By then , the Pagan Empire , despite outward appearances of calm , had been in long and slow decline since the early 13th century 
 The continuous growth of tax @-@ free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom 
 The crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen , inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges 
 Although it was able to put down the first batch of serious rebellions in <unk> – 60 in South <unk> and <unk> ( <unk> ) , the decline continued 
 On the eve of the <unk> invasions , between one and two @-@ thirds of Upper Burma 's <unk> land had been donated to religion 
 The crown 's ability to <unk> defenses was in serious jeopardy 
The period of calm for Pagan ended in the early <unk> 
 By then , the Song were on the ropes , and Emperor <unk> Khan , who officially founded the Yuan dynasty on 18 December 1271 , sought to cut off the retreat of Song refugees in all directions 
 In Pagan 's case , he had ordered the <unk> governor of <unk> to <unk> control of the <unk> , and in January 1271 to send a mission to Pagan to demand tribute 
 The tribute he demanded was nominal 
 Given his higher priority <unk> elsewhere , the emperor was not looking to replace the regime at Pagan 
 At the border , the ruler of the <unk> and <unk> regions submitted to the Mongols 
When the <unk> envoys led by <unk> <unk> showed up , the Pagan court led by Chief Minister <unk> <unk> was well aware of the military power of the Mongols and advised King <unk> to use diplomacy 
 The king was furious at the demand and kept the <unk> envoys waiting for weeks 
 The court finally devised a compromise : the envoys were sent back without ever seeing the king 
 <unk> them was a <unk> envoy who carried a letter expressing friendly sentiments and the <unk> king 's wish to one day worship a Buddha tooth at Beijing 
 The king then promptly ordered an expedition , which retook the rebellious <unk> regions in April <unk> 
 The rebel leader A @-@ <unk> ( <unk> ) was brought back to Pagan 
 <unk> relayed the news to Beijing but did not carry out any military action 
This time , the <unk> king received the imperial envoys but still refused to submit 
 ( The <unk> chronicles say that the king was so insulted that he had the envoys executed 
 But both <unk> <unk> evidence and Yuan records indicate that the envoys were not executed 
 ) At any rate , the imperial envoys did not get back to <unk> in due time 
 The newly formed <unk> government sent another delegation to investigate the whereabouts of the delegation , but the delegation could not reach Pagan because of an ongoing rebellion en route 
But the emperor rejected an outright invasion 
 Just coming off a disastrous Japanese campaign , the emperor was unwilling to commit the central government troops to what he considered a low priority affair 
 He was now focused on delivering the final blow against the Song ; the emperor ordered the <unk> provincial army to secure the <unk> in order to block the escape path of the Song refugees 
 He also sanctioned a limited border war if Pagan contested the takeover 
 As planned , the <unk> army proceeded to consolidate the <unk> in 1275 – 76 
 ( Elsewhere , the main <unk> armies had captured most of the Song territory by <unk> 
The <unk> army pressed on after the monsoon season 
 In the following dry season of <unk> – 78 , c 
 December <unk> , a <unk> army of <unk> led by <unk> al @-@ Din , son of <unk> <unk> <unk> , advanced to <unk> , which defended the <unk> Pass 
 They occupied the fort and destroyed a large number of abandoned <unk> 
 But they found the heat excessive and returned 
Despite the <unk> military success , the control of the <unk> remained contested 
 Pagan did not relinquish its claim to the frontier regions , and the <unk> , apparently taking advantage of <unk> <unk> elsewhere , rebuilt their forts at <unk> and <unk> later in <unk> , posting permanent garrisons commanded by <unk> <unk> 
 But their control was short @-@ lived 
 The Great Khan 's attention turned to Southeast Asia once more in 1281 
 He had had mixed success : his <unk> forces had finished off the last of the Song in 1279 but had again failed to take Japan in 1281 
 That year , the <unk> emperor sent another mission to Pagan , demanding tribute yet again 
 The <unk> king was to send his ten senior ministers accompanied by one thousand cavalry officers to the emperor 's court 
 ( With <unk> , the emperor summoned the king of <unk> himself to Beijing 
At Pagan , <unk> <unk> with his court for an appropriate response but ultimately refused to submit 
 The <unk> court may have been counting on another limited border war but the emperor now ordered an invasion of northern Burma 
 ( He also ordered an invasion of <unk> , whose king too had refused to submit 
 ) The <unk> king 's troubles did not go <unk> elsewhere in the kingdom 
 In the same year , a <unk> named <unk> seized the southern port city of <unk> ( <unk> ) by killing its Pagan @-@ appointed governor 
 Although the king 's three sons were <unk> of the nearby Lower Burma cities ( in <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , and <unk> ) , the king , preoccupied with much more serious threat in the north , did not ( or could not ) take any action on <unk> 
Throughout <unk> , the <unk> command made preparations for the upcoming invasions of <unk> and northern Burma 
 The objective of the Burma campaign was to take over northern Burma but no further ; the emperor did not <unk> an attack on Pagan itself 
 At least one army consisted of 14 @,@ 000 men of the <unk> Persian <unk> Empire under the command of <unk> <unk> was sent to <unk> to reinforce the Burma invasion force , which again was made up of Turks and other central <unk> 
 On the <unk> side , the king managed to raise an army although given his low standing with his vassals , he probably could not have raised a large one 
 By mid @-@ <unk> , a <unk> army led by generals <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> was deployed at a fort at <unk> 
The invasion began on 22 September <unk> 
 Prince <unk> was the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the invasion force ; his deputies were Vice Governor <unk> , and commander <unk> <unk> 
 The <unk> armies marched to the border in two columns 
 One column advanced along the <unk> River using over 200 boats ; the other proceeded by land and joined the first column at the <unk> fort at <unk> 
 The <unk> chronicles report an overwhelming number of <unk> forces laying siege to the fort although their numbers are greatly exaggerated 
 ( The chronicles say that the <unk> army numbered 400 @,@ 000 men while the <unk> army numbered 20 million men and 6 million horses 
 ) The <unk> withstood the siege for over two months but the fort fell on 3 December <unk> 
The defeat at <unk> broke the back of <unk> defenses 
 The <unk> army lost several thousand men as well as senior commanders 
 <unk> , the next fort <unk> , fell just six days later on 9 December <unk> 
 The <unk> sources say that the <unk> lost 10 @,@ 000 men at <unk> 
 The <unk> armies pushed farther south into the <unk> valley 
 They took the ancient <unk> capital of <unk> , about 380 km north of Pagan on 5 February <unk> 
 There , the invaders paused their advance 
 They found the heat of the searing <unk> valley excessive , and evacuated <unk> , allowing the <unk> to return to <unk> on 10 May <unk> 
 But the <unk> army renewed their offensive in the following dry season 
 They retook <unk> , and defeated another <unk> stand south of <unk> , probably near <unk> , on 26 January <unk> , opening the way to Pagan , about 270 km south 
 After the defeat , the king <unk> , and fled to Lower Burma 
 The evacuation proved premature 
 The <unk> forces did not advance on Pagan as it was not part of their invasion plan 
The country fell into chaos 
 In Lower Burma , the king found himself isolated , let alone plan a counterattack 
 Although his sons ruled the key Lower Burma ports ( <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ) , the king did not trust any of them , and he and his court settled at <unk> , west of <unk> 
 Without the full support of his sons , the presence of the king and his small army impressed no one 
 The governor of <unk> <unk> that same year 
 The king managed to send two small expeditions to <unk> but they both failed 
 Now , the entire eastern half of Lower Burma ( <unk> and <unk> ) was in open revolt 
Given his precarious position , <unk> decided to buy time , and sue for peace with the Mongols 
 In November / December <unk> , the king ordered his generals <unk> <unk> and <unk> Bo to enter into ceasefire negotiations 
 The <unk> commanders at <unk> , who had organized northern Burma as a protectorate named <unk> ( Chinese : <unk> ; Wade – Giles : <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , agreed to a ceasefire but insisted on a full submission 
 They repeated their 1281 demand that the <unk> king send a formal delegation to the emperor 
 The two sides had reached a tentative agreement by 3 March <unk> , which calls for a full submission of the Pagan Empire , and central Burma to be organized as the province of <unk> ( Chinese : <unk> ; Wade – Giles : <unk> @-@ Chung ) 
 After a long <unk> , the king agreed to submit but wanted the <unk> troops to withdraw 
 In June <unk> , he sent an embassy led by Shin <unk> <unk> , a learned monk , to the emperor 's court 
In January <unk> , the embassy arrived at Beijing , and was received by the Yuan emperor 
 The <unk> delegation formally acknowledged <unk> <unk> of their kingdom , and agreed to pay annual tribute tied to the agricultural output of the country 
 ( Indeed , the tribute was no longer nominal 
 ) In exchange , the emperor agreed to withdraw his troops 
 For the emperor , the Burma campaign was the only bright spot ; his other Southeast Asian expeditions had gone badly 
 He did not want to invest more troops <unk> the rest of the kingdom 
 He preferred a vassal ruler 
 The <unk> embassy arrived back at <unk> in May <unk> , and reported the terms to the king 
But the agreement broke down a month later 
 In late June , the defeated king and his small retinue left their temporary capital for Pagan 
 But on 1 July <unk> , the king was captured en route and assassinated by his second son <unk> , the Viceroy of <unk> 
 Anarchy ensued 
 Each region in the country which had not <unk> broke away 
 No successor to <unk> , who could honor and enforce the terms of the treaty of Beijing , emerged 
 Indeed , a king would not emerge until May <unk> 
Recent research shows that the <unk> forces most probably never reached Pagan 
 They were held at bay by the <unk> defenses led by commanders <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and probably never got closer than 160 km north of Pagan 
 ( An inscription dated 16 February <unk> by the three brothers claimed that they defeated the <unk> army 
 ) Even if the Mongols did reach Pagan , the damage they inflicted was probably minimal 
 At any rate , the <unk> army suffered heavy casualties , and retreated north to <unk> 
 They remained there as the treaty was now void 
The disintegration of the Pagan Empire was now complete 
 But the Mongols refused to fill in the power vacuum they had created 
 They would send no more expeditions to restore order 
 The emperor apparently had no interest in committing troops that would be required to <unk> the fragmented country 
 Indeed , his real aim all along may have been " to keep the entire region of Southeast Asia broken and fragmented 
 " It would be another two years until one of <unk> 's sons , <unk> , emerged as king of Pagan in May <unk> 
 But the new " king " controlled just a small area around the capital , and had no real army 
 The real power in central Burma now rested with the three commander brothers 
The uneasy arrangement would persist until <unk> 
 The Mongols continued to occupy northern Burma to <unk> as the province of <unk> ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) but ended the fictional central Burma province of <unk> on 18 August <unk> 
 Meanwhile , the power struggle in central Burma continued with the three brothers <unk> consolidating support 
 To check their rising power , <unk> submitted to the Mongols in January <unk> , and was recognized by the Yuan emperor <unk> Khan as King of Pagan on 20 March <unk> 
 The emperor also gave Chinese titles to the brothers as subordinates of <unk> 
 The brothers resented the new arrangement as it directly reduced their power 
 On 17 December <unk> , the three brothers <unk> <unk> , and founded the <unk> Kingdom 
 The <unk> forced the <unk> government to intervene again , leading to the second <unk> invasion of Burma ( 1300 – 01 ) 
 The invasion failed 
 Two years later , on 4 April <unk> , the Mongols abolished the province of <unk> ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , evacuated <unk> , and returned to <unk> 
The immediate result of the war was the collapse of the Pagan Empire 
 However , the war merely accelerated the collapse but did not cause it 
 Pagan 's disintegration was " in fact more prolonged and <unk> 
 " The kingdom had been in long gradual decline since the early 13th century 
 Had Pagan possessed a stronger central government , the collapse could have been temporary , and the country “ could have risen again ” 
 But the dynasty could not recover , and because the Mongols refused to fill the power vacuum , no viable center emerged in the immediate aftermath 
 As a result , several minor states fought it out for supremacy for the better part of the 14th century 
 It was only in the late 14th century that two relatively strong powers emerged in the <unk> basin , restoring some semblance of normalcy 
 The vast region surrounding the <unk> valley would continue to be made up of several small Tai @-@ Shan states well into the 16th century 
Perhaps the most enduring legacy of the <unk> invasions was the emergence of Tai @-@ Shan states in mainland Southeast Asia 
 The Tai @-@ Shan people who came down with the <unk> invasions stayed 
 By the early 14th century , several Tai @-@ Shan states had come to dominate a vast region from present @-@ day <unk> to northern and eastern <unk> to northern and central Thailand and Laos 
 Their rise was encouraged by the Mongols , who viewed the states as a useful <unk> between <unk> and the rest of Southeast Asia 
 The Mongols , who were still trying to incorporate <unk> into the central administration , were unwilling or unable to make necessary sustained investments to bring the vast regions south of <unk> into the fold 
 ( The integration of <unk> itself into “ China <unk> ” was to take several more centuries , and continues to today 
 ) As such , from the newly formed Tai @-@ Shan states in western and central Southeast Asia to Dai Viet and <unk> in eastern Southeast Asia , the Mongols elected to receive nominal tribute 
 Though the rulers of these states were technically governors of the Yuan government , they were the native chieftains , “ who would have ruled there in any case , and they did as they pleased 
The war also marked the arrival of China at the <unk> of Burma 
 The old <unk> Kingdom , known to the <unk> as <unk> ( <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , after <unk> Raj ) was now a <unk> Chinese province 
 ( The <unk> now called the new powers at <unk> " <unk> " after the <unk> @-@ speaking soldiers of <unk> 
 Over the years , the term <unk> came to be used to refer to the Han Chinese 
 Today , King <unk> is remembered as <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> , ( " the King who fled from the <unk> [ Chinese ] ) 
 ) From a <unk> standpoint , the <unk> – Chinese presence in <unk> pushed the Shan migrations in the direction of Burma ( and parts of the Khmer Empire ) 
 The raids by various Shan states into Upper Burma would continue until the mid @-@ 16th century 
In the battle , U
S
 Marines , under the overall command of U
S
 Major General Alexander <unk> , repulsed an attack by the Japanese 35th Infantry Brigade , under the command of Japanese Major General <unk> <unk> 
 The Marines were defending the <unk> perimeter that guarded Henderson Field on <unk> , which was captured from the Japanese by the Allies in landings on <unk> on 7 August 1942 
 <unk> 's unit was sent to <unk> in response to the Allied landings with the mission of <unk> the airfield and driving the Allied forces from the island 
<unk> the strength of Allied forces on <unk> – about 12 @,@ 000 – <unk> 's 6 @,@ 000 soldiers conducted several nighttime frontal assaults on the U
S
 defenses 
 The main Japanese assault occurred around <unk> ridge south of Henderson Field , manned by troops from several U
S
 Marine Corps units , primarily troops from the 1st <unk> and 1st Parachute Battalions under U
S
 Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Merritt A
 <unk> 
 Although the Marine defenses were almost overrun , <unk> 's attack was ultimately defeated , with heavy losses for the Japanese 
On 7 August 1942 , Allied forces ( primarily U
S
 ) landed on <unk> , <unk> , and Florida Islands in the Solomon Islands 
 The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as bases for threatening the supply routes between the U
S
 and Australia 
 They were also intended to secure the islands as starting points for a campaign to neutralize the major Japanese base at Rabaul and support the Allied New Guinea campaign 
 The landings initiated the six @-@ month @-@ long <unk> campaign 
In response to the Allied landings on <unk> , the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters assigned the Imperial Japanese Army 's 17th Army — a corps @-@ sized command based at Rabaul ( 4 ° 11 ′ 56 ″ S 152 ° 9 ′ 57 ″ E ) and under the command of Lieutenant @-@ General <unk> <unk> — with the task of retaking <unk> from Allied forces 
 The 17th Army — heavily involved with the Japanese campaign in New Guinea — had only a few units available to send to the southern <unk> area 
 Of these units , the 35th Infantry Brigade — under Major General <unk> <unk> — was at <unk> , the 4th ( <unk> ) Infantry Regiment was in the Philippines and the 28th ( <unk> ) Infantry Regiment — under the command of Colonel <unk> <unk> — was embarked on transport ships near Guam 
 The different units began to move toward <unk> immediately ; <unk> 's regiment — the closest — arrived first 
 The " First <unk> " of <unk> 's unit — consisting of about <unk> soldiers — landed from destroyers at <unk> Point ( 9 ° 24 ′ 38 ″ S 160 ° 20 ′ 56 ″ E ) , about 18 mi ( 29 km ) east of the <unk> perimeter , on August 19 
By 23 August , <unk> 's unit had reached <unk> and was loaded onto slow transport ships for the rest of the trip to <unk> 
 Because of the damage caused by Allied air attack to a separate troop convoy during the Battle of the Eastern <unk> , the Japanese decided not to deliver <unk> 's troops to <unk> by slow transport ship ; instead , the ships carrying <unk> 's soldiers were sent to Rabaul 
 From there , the Japanese planned to deliver <unk> 's men to <unk> by destroyers , staging through a Japanese naval base in the <unk> Islands 
 The Japanese destroyers were usually able to make the round trip down " The <unk> " to <unk> and back in a single night , <unk> their exposure to Allied air attack 
 However , most of the soldiers ' heavy equipment and supplies , such as heavy artillery , vehicles , and much food and ammunition , could not be taken to <unk> with them 
 These high @-@ speed destroyer runs to <unk> , which occurred throughout the campaign , were later called the " Tokyo Express " by Allied forces and " Rat Transportation " by the Japanese 
 The Japanese controlled the seas around the Solomon Islands during the nighttime and were not challenged by the Allies 
 However , any Japanese ship remaining within the 200 mi ( 320 km ) range of the aircraft at Henderson Field in daylight was in great danger from air attacks 
 This " curious tactical situation " held for several months 
On 28 August , 600 of <unk> 's troops were loaded onto the destroyers <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , designated Destroyer Division 20 ( <unk> ) 
 Because of a shortage of fuel , <unk> could not make the entire round trip to <unk> at high speed in one night , but had to start the trip earlier in the day so that they could complete the trip by the next morning at a slower speed which <unk> fuel 
 At 18 : 05 that day , 11 U
S
 dive bombers from <unk> @-@ 232 under the command of Lt
 Col
 Richard <unk> , flew from Henderson Field and located and attacked <unk> about 70 mi ( 110 km ) north of <unk> , sinking <unk> and heavily damaging <unk> and <unk> 
 <unk> took <unk> in tow and the three destroyers returned to the <unk> without completing their mission 
 The attack on <unk> killed 62 of <unk> 's soldiers and 94 crew members 
Subsequent " Express " runs were more successful 
 Between 29 August and 4 September , various Japanese light cruisers , destroyers , and patrol boats were able to land almost 5 @,@ 000 troops at <unk> Point , including all of the 35th Infantry Brigade , one battalion of the <unk> Regiment , and the rest of <unk> 's regiment 
 General <unk> , who landed at <unk> Point on the 31 August Express run , was placed in command of all the Japanese troops on <unk> 
 On the night of 4 / 5 September , as three of the Express destroyers — <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> — prepared to shell Henderson Field after landing their troops , they detected and sank two U
S
 ships in the vicinity , the small , old destroyer transports ( called " <unk> " by the U
S
 Marines ) USS Little and Gregory that were used to <unk> Allied troops around the <unk> / <unk> area 
In spite of the successes of the destroyer runs , <unk> insisted that as many soldiers of his brigade as possible be delivered to <unk> by slow barges 
 Therefore , a convoy carrying 1 @,@ 100 of <unk> 's troops and heavy equipment in 61 barges , mainly from the 2nd Battalion , <unk> Infantry Regiment under the command of Colonel <unk> <unk> , departed the northern coast of Santa Isabel Island on 2 September 
 On 4 – 5 September , aircraft from Henderson Field attacked the barge convoy , killing about 90 of the soldiers in the barges and destroying much of the unit 's heavy equipment 
 Most of the remaining 1 @,@ 000 troops were able to land near <unk> ( 9 ° 15 ′ 32 ″ S 159 ° 40 ′ 18 ″ E ) , west of the <unk> perimeter over the next few days 
 By 7 September , <unk> had 5 @,@ 200 troops at <unk> Point and 1 @,@ 000 west of the <unk> perimeter 
 <unk> was confident enough that he could defeat the Allied forces facing him that he declined an offer from the 17th Army for delivery of one more infantry battalion to augment his forces 
 <unk> believed that there were only about 2 @,@ 000 U
S
 Marines on <unk> 
During this time , <unk> continued to direct efforts to strengthen and improve the defenses of the <unk> perimeter 
 Between 21 August and 3 September , he relocated three Marine battalions — including the 1st <unk> Battalion , under U
S
 Lieutenant Colonel Merritt A
 <unk> ( <unk> 's Raiders ) , and the 1st Parachute Battalion — from <unk> and <unk> to <unk> 
 These units added about 1 @,@ 500 troops to <unk> 's original 11 @,@ 000 men defending Henderson Field 
 The 1st Parachute battalion , which had suffered heavy casualties in the Battle of <unk> and <unk> @-@ <unk> in August , was placed under <unk> 's command 
<unk> set the date for his attack on the <unk> perimeter for 12 September and began marching his forces west from <unk> towards <unk> Point on 5 September 
 He <unk> 17th Army and requested that it carry out air strikes on Henderson Field beginning on 9 September , and that naval warships be stationed off <unk> Point on September 12 to " destroy any Americans who attempted to flee from the island 
 " On 7 September , <unk> issued his attack plan to " <unk> and <unk> the enemy in the vicinity of the <unk> Island airfield 
 " <unk> 's plan called for his forces to split into three , approach the <unk> perimeter inland , and launch a surprise night attack 
 <unk> 's force would attack the perimeter from the west while <unk> 's Second <unk> — renamed the <unk> Battalion — would attack from the east 
 The main attack would be by <unk> 's " Center Body " , numbering 3 @,@ 000 men in three battalions , from the south of the <unk> perimeter 
 By 7 September , most of <unk> 's troops had started marching from <unk> towards <unk> Point along the coastline 
 About 250 Japanese troops remained behind to guard the brigade 's supply base at <unk> 
Meanwhile , native island scouts — directed by British government official and officer in the British Solomon Islands <unk> Defence Force , Martin <unk> — told the Marines of Japanese troops at <unk> , near the village of <unk> , about 17 mi ( 27 km ) east of <unk> 
 <unk> launched a raid against the Japanese troops at <unk> 
 Destroyer transports USS McKean and <unk> and two patrol boats took <unk> of <unk> 's men to <unk> in two trips 
 <unk> and his first wave of <unk> troops landed at <unk> at 05 : 20 ( local time ) on 8 September 
 <unk> by aircraft from Henderson Field and gunfire from the destroyer transports , <unk> 's men advanced towards <unk> village but were slowed by Japanese resistance 
 At 11 : 00 , the rest of <unk> 's men landed 
 With this reinforcement and more support from the Henderson Field aircraft , <unk> 's force pushed into the village 
 The Japanese defenders , believing a major landing was underway after observing the concurrent approach of an Allied supply ship convoy heading towards <unk> Point , retreated into the jungle , leaving behind 27 dead 
 Two Marines were killed 
<unk> and Colonel Gerald Thomas , <unk> 's operations officer , believed that the Japanese attack would come at the <unk> Ridge , a narrow , grassy , 1 @,@ 000 m ( 1 @,@ 100 yd ) long , coral ridge ( 9 ° 26 ′ 39 ″ S 160 ° 2 ′ 50 ″ E ) parallel to the <unk> River just south of Henderson Field 
 The ridge offered a natural <unk> of approach to the airfield , commanded the surrounding area and was almost undefended 
 <unk> and Thomas tried to persuade <unk> to move forces to defend the ridge , but <unk> refused , believing that the Japanese were more likely to attack along the coast 
 Finally , Thomas convinced <unk> that the ridge was a good location for <unk> 's Raiders to " rest " from their actions of the preceding month 
 On 11 September , the 840 men of <unk> 's unit — including the 1st Raiders and the <unk> — deployed onto and around the ridge and prepared to defend it 
<unk> 's Center Body of troops was planning to attack the <unk> perimeter at the ridge , which they called " the <unk> " ( <unk> <unk> ) because of its shape 
 On 9 September , <unk> 's troops left the coast at <unk> Point 
 <unk> into four columns , they marched into the jungle towards their <unk> attack points south and southeast of the airfield 
 <unk> of good maps , at least one faulty <unk> , and thick , almost impenetrable jungle caused the Japanese columns to proceed slowly and <unk> , costing a lot of time 
 At the same time , <unk> 's troops approached the <unk> perimeter from the west 
 <unk> had some intelligence on the Marine defenses , extracted from a U
S
 Army pilot captured on 30 August 
During the day of 12 September , <unk> 's troops struggled through the jungle toward their assembly points for that night 's attacks 
 <unk> wanted his three Center Body battalions in place by 14 : 00 , but they did not reach their assembly areas until after 22 : 00 
 <unk> was also delayed in his advance towards the Marine lines in the west 
 Only the <unk> battalion reported that they were in place on time 
 Despite the problems in reaching the planned attack positions , <unk> was still confident in his attack plan because a captured U
S
 pilot disclosed that the ridge was the weakest part of the Marine defenses 
 Japanese bombers attacked the ridge during daytime on 11 – 12 September , causing a few casualties , including two killed 
The Americans knew of the approach of the Japanese forces from reports from native scouts and their own patrols , but did not know exactly where or when they would attack 
 The ridge around which <unk> deployed his men consisted of three distinct <unk> 
 At the southern tip and surrounded on three sides by thick jungle was Hill 80 ( so named because it rose 80 ft ( 24 m ) above sea level ) 
 Six hundred yards north was Hill 123 ( 123 ft ( 37 m ) high ) , the dominant feature on the ridge 
 The <unk> <unk> was unnamed and about 60 ft ( 18 m ) high 
 <unk> placed the five companies from the <unk> battalion on the west side of the ridge and the three Parachute battalion companies on the east side , holding positions in depth from Hill 80 back to Hill 123 
 Two of the five <unk> companies , " B " and " C " , held a line between the ridge , a small , swampy <unk> , and the <unk> River 
 Machine @-@ gun teams from " E " Company , the heavy weapons company , were scattered throughout the defenses 
 <unk> placed his command post on Hill 123 
At 21 : 30 on 12 September , the Japanese cruiser <unk> and three destroyers shelled the <unk> perimeter for 20 minutes and illuminated the ridge with a <unk> 
 Japanese artillery began shelling the Marine lines , but did little damage 
 At the same time , scattered groups of <unk> 's troops began <unk> with Marines around the ridge 
 <unk> 's 1st Battalion — led by Major <unk> <unk> — attacked the <unk> 's " C " company between the <unk> and the <unk> River , overrunning at least one platoon and forcing the Marine company to fall back to the ridge 
 <unk> 's unit became entangled with troops from <unk> 's 3rd Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel <unk> <unk> , who were still struggling to reach their attack positions , and the resulting confusion effectively stopped the Japanese attack on the ridge that night 
 <unk> , who was having trouble locating where he was in relation to the U
S
 Marine lines as well as coordinating his troops ' attacks , later complained , " Due to the <unk> jungle , the brigade was scattered all over and was completely beyond my control 
 In my whole life I have never felt so disappointed and helpless 
 " Twelve U
S
 Marines were killed ; Japanese casualties are unknown but perhaps somewhat greater 
 Although both <unk> in the west and the <unk> unit in the east tried to attack the Marine lines that night , they failed to make contact and halted near the Marine lines at dawn 
<unk> the Japanese to attack again that night , <unk> directed his troops to improve their defenses on and around the ridge 
 After a failed attempt by two companies to retake the ground on the Marine right flank lost to <unk> the night before , <unk> <unk> his forces 
 He pulled his front back about 400 yd ( 370 m ) to a line that stretched 1 @,@ 800 yd ( 1 @,@ 600 m ) , starting at the <unk> River and crossing the ridge about 150 yd ( 140 m ) south of Hill 123 
 Around and behind Hill 123 he placed five companies 
 Any Japanese attackers <unk> Hill 80 would have to advance over 400 yd ( 370 m ) of open terrain to close with the Marine positions at Hill 123 
 With only a few hours to prepare , the Marines were only able to construct rudimentary and shallow fortifications 
 They were low on ammunition , with one or two grenades for each Marine 
 <unk> ordered a reserve force consisting of the 2nd Battalion , 5th Marine Regiment ( 2 / 5 ) to move into a position just to the rear of <unk> 's troops 
 In addition , a battery of four <unk> howitzers from the 11th Marine Regiment moved to a location from where it could provide direct fire onto the ridge , and a forward artillery observer was placed with <unk> 's front line units 
You men have done a great job , and I have just one more thing to ask of you 
 <unk> out just one more night 
 I know we 've been without sleep a long time 
 But we expect another attack from them tonight and they may come through here 
 I have every reason to believe that we will have reliefs here for all of us in the morning 
As the sun set on 13 September , <unk> faced <unk> 's 830 Marines with 3 @,@ 000 troops of his brigade , plus an assortment of light artillery 
 The night was pitch black , with no moon 
 At 21 : 00 , seven Japanese destroyers briefly bombarded the ridge 
 <unk> 's attack began just after nightfall , with <unk> 's battalion assaulting <unk> Company B on the Marine right flank , just to the west of the ridge 
 The force of the assault caused Company B to fall back to Hill 123 
 Under Marine artillery fire , <unk> reassembled his men and continued his attack 
 Without <unk> to try to " roll @-@ up " the other nearby Marine units , whose flanks were now unprotected , <unk> 's unit <unk> forward through the swampy lowlands between the ridge and the <unk> River , heading for the airfield 
 <unk> 's men came upon a pile of Marine supplies and rations 
 Not having eaten adequately for a couple of days , they paused to " <unk> themselves " on the " C " and " K " rations 
 <unk> ordered his men to continue the attack 
 At about 03 : 00 , he led them against the Marine units around the northern portion of the ridge , just short of the airfield , as well as Hill 123 
 In the heavy fighting that followed , <unk> and around 100 of his men were killed , ending that attack 
Meanwhile , <unk> 's 2nd Battalion , under Major <unk> Tamura , assembled for their planned assault against Hill 80 from the jungle south of the ridge 
 Marine observers spotted Tamura 's preparations and called in artillery fire 
 At about 22 : 00 , a barrage from twelve 105 mm ( 4 @
@ 1 in ) guns hit Tamura 's position 
 In response , two companies of Tamura 's troops — numbering about 320 men — charged up Hill 80 with fixed bayonets behind their own barrage of mortar fire and grenades 
 Tamura 's attack hit Company B of the Marine Parachute battalion and also <unk> Company B , pushing the <unk> off the east side of the ridge into a draw below the <unk> 
 To protect the exposed <unk> Company B , <unk> immediately ordered them to pull back onto Hill 123 
At the same time , a Japanese company from <unk> 's battalion infiltrated through a gap between the east side of the ridge and Parachute Company C
 <unk> that their positions were now <unk> , Parachute Companies B and C climbed onto the ridge and retreated to a position behind Hill 123 
 In the darkness and confusion of the battle , the retreat quickly became confused and disorganized 
 A few Marines began <unk> that the Japanese were attacking with poison gas , <unk> other Marines who no longer possessed their gas masks 
 After arriving behind Hill 123 , some of the Marines continued on towards the airfield , repeating the word " withdraw " to anyone within <unk> 
 Other Marines began to follow them 
 Just at the moment that it appeared that the Marines on the hill were about to break and head for the rear in a <unk> , <unk> , Major Kenneth D
 Bailey from <unk> 's staff , and other Marine officers appeared and , with " vivid " language , <unk> the Marines back into defensive positions around Hill 123 
As the Marines formed into a <unk> @-@ shaped line around Hill 123 , Tamura 's battalion began a series of frontal assaults on the hill , charging up the saddle from Hill 80 and up from below the east side of the ridge 
 Under the light of parachute flares dropped by at least one Japanese <unk> , the Marines repulsed the first two attacks by Tamura 's men 
 Tamura 's troops <unk> a 75 mm ( 2 @
@ 95 in ) " regimental " gun to the top of Hill 80 in an effort to fire it directly at the Marines 
 This gun , which " could have turned the tide in favor of the Japanese , " however , was disabled by a faulty firing pin 
 At midnight , during a short lull in the fighting , <unk> ordered Parachute Companies B and C to advance from behind Hill 123 to strengthen his left flank 
 With fixed bayonets , the <unk> swept forward , killing Japanese soldiers who had overrun the Marine lines and were apparently preparing to roll up the Marine lines from the flank , and took position on the east side of the hill 
 Marines from other units , as well as members of <unk> 's command staff , including Major Bailey , took ammunition and grenades under fire to the Marines around Hill 123 , who were running critically low 
 Said Marine participant Captain William J
 <unk> , " The Japanese attack was almost constant , like a rain that <unk> for a moment and then <unk> the harder 


 When one wave was <unk> down - and I mean <unk> down - another followed it into death 
During the heavy fighting , portions of three Japanese companies , including two from Tamura 's and one from <unk> 's battalions , <unk> the Marine defenses on the ridge , while suffering heavy losses from Marine gunfire , and reached the edge of " Fighter One " , a secondary runway of Henderson Field 
 A counterattack by the Marine engineers stopped one Japanese company 's advances and forced it to retreat 
 The other two companies waited at the edge of the jungle for reinforcements to arrive before attacking into the open area around the airfield 
 When no reinforcements joined them , both companies went back to their original positions south of the ridge after <unk> 
 Most of the rest of <unk> 's battalion did not participate in the battle because they lost contact with their commander during the night 
As the sun rose on 14 September , pockets of Japanese soldiers remained scattered along both sides of the ridge 
 But with Tamura 's battalion shattered after losing <unk> of its officers and men , and with heavy casualties to his other attacking units as well , <unk> 's assault on the ridge had effectively ended 
 About 100 Japanese soldiers still remained in the open on the south slope of Hill 80 , perhaps preparing for one more charge on Hill 123 
 At first light , three U
S
 Army aircraft from the 67th Fighter Squadron at Henderson Field , acting on a request personally delivered by Bailey , <unk> the Japanese near Hill 80 and killed most of them , with the few survivors retreating back into the jungle 
As the battle on the ridge took place , <unk> 's <unk> and <unk> units also attacked the Marine defenses on the east and west sides of the <unk> perimeter 
 The <unk> battalion — led by Major Takeshi <unk> — attacked the southeastern sector of the <unk> perimeter , defended by Marines of the 3rd Battalion , 1st Marine Regiment ( 3 / 1 ) 
 <unk> 's attack started around midnight , with one company attacking through Marine artillery fire and engaging in hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat with the Marine defenders before being thrown back 
 <unk> was killed in the attack 
 After <unk> , the Marines , believing that the rest of <unk> 's battalion was still in the area , sent forward six light tanks without infantry support to sweep the area in front of the Marine lines ; four Japanese 37 mm ( 1 @
@ 46 in ) anti @-@ tank guns destroyed or disabled three of them 
 After abandoning their burning tanks , several of the disabled tanks ' <unk> were <unk> and killed by the Japanese 
 One tank <unk> down an embankment into the <unk> River , drowning its crew 
At 13 : 05 on 14 September , <unk> led the survivors of his shattered brigade away from the ridge and deeper into the jungle , where they rested and tended to their wounded all the next day 
 <unk> 's units were then ordered to withdraw west to the <unk> River valley to join with <unk> 's unit , a 6 mi ( 9 @
@ 7 km ) march over difficult terrain 
 <unk> 's troops began the march on the morning of 16 September 
 Almost every soldier able to walk had to help carry the wounded 
 As the march progressed , the exhausted and hungry soldiers , who had eaten their last rations on the morning before their withdrawal , began to <unk> their heavy equipment and then their rifles 
 By the time most of them reached <unk> 's positions at <unk> five days later , only half still carried their weapons 
 The <unk> battalion 's survivors , attempting to follow <unk> 's Center Body forces , became lost , wandered for three weeks in the jungle , and almost <unk> to death before finally reaching <unk> 's camp 
On 17 September , <unk> sent two companies from the 1st Battalion , 1st Marine Regiment ( 1 / 1 ) to pursue the retreating Japanese 
 The Marines were ambushed by two Japanese companies acting as rear @-@ guards for the withdrawal , and one Marine platoon was pinned down as the rest of the Marines retreated 
 The Marine company commander requested permission to attempt to rescue his platoon but was denied by <unk> 
 By nightfall , the Japanese overran and nearly annihilated the platoon , killing 24 Marines with only a few wounded members of the platoon surviving 
 On 20 September , a patrol from <unk> 's Raiders encountered stragglers from <unk> 's retreating column and called in artillery fire that killed 19 of them 
As the Japanese regrouped west of the <unk> , the U
S
 forces concentrated on shoring up and strengthening their <unk> defenses 
 On 14 September , <unk> moved another battalion , the 3rd Battalion , 2nd Marine Regiment ( 3 / 2 ) , from <unk> to <unk> 
 On 18 September , an Allied naval convoy delivered 4 @,@ 157 men from the 3rd Provisional Marine Brigade ( the U
S
 7th Marine Regiment augmented by additional support units ) to <unk> 
 These reinforcements allowed <unk> — beginning on 19 September — to establish an unbroken line of defense around the <unk> perimeter 
 <unk> 's forces ' next significant clashes with the Japanese occurred along the <unk> River from 23 – 27 September and 6 – 9 October 
On 15 September , General <unk> at Rabaul learned of <unk> 's defeat , the Imperial Japanese Army 's first defeat involving a unit of this size in the war 
 The general <unk> the news to the Imperial General Headquarters in Japan 
 In an emergency session , the top Japanese army and navy command staffs concluded that , " <unk> might develop into the decisive battle of the war 
 " The results of the battle began to have a telling strategic impact on Japanese operations in other areas of the Pacific 
 <unk> realized that , in order to send sufficient troops and materiel to defeat the Allied forces on <unk> , he could no longer support the major Japanese offensive on the <unk> Track in New Guinea 
 <unk> — with the <unk> of the General Headquarters — ordered his troops on New Guinea , who were within 30 mi ( 48 km ) of their objective of Port Moresby — to withdraw until the <unk> matter was resolved 
 The Japanese were never able to restart their drive towards Port Moresby ; the defeat at <unk> 's Ridge contributed not only to Japan 's defeat in the <unk> campaign , but also to Japan 's ultimate defeat throughout the South Pacific

 In 1917 , what is now Route 50 was designated a part of pre @-@ 1927 Route 14 , a route that was to run from Cape May to <unk> Harbor City 
 Route 50 was designated onto its current alignment in 1927 , replacing this portion of pre @-@ 1927 Route 14 
 In 1960 , a freeway was proposed for Route 50 , running from the Garden State Parkway in Dennis Township to US 30 in <unk> Township 
 This proposal was canceled by the mid @-@ 1970s due to financial and environmental concerns as well as lack of traffic 
 The interchange between Route 50 and the Atlantic City Expressway was reconstructed into a full interchange , with completion in June 2010 
Route 50 begins at an intersection with US 9 in the <unk> section of Upper Township , Cape May County , heading to the north on a two @-@ lane undivided road 
 From the southern terminus , a ramp provides access to and from the southbound Garden State Parkway 
 The road heads north through mostly rural wooded areas with some buildings 
 It intersects CR <unk> in <unk> before coming to a junction with CR <unk> 
 Later , Route 50 Cedar Swamp Creek in an area of <unk> 
 At this crossing , the road runs closely parallel to a <unk> <unk> <unk> Operations railroad line before entering Petersburg , where it splits from the railroad tracks and comes to a <unk> with CR 610 
 Upon leaving Petersburg , Route 50 turns to the north again and crosses over the <unk> <unk> <unk> Operations railroad line , intersecting CR <unk> 
 It continues to <unk> and comes to CR <unk> 
 Past this intersection , the route meets CR <unk> and CR <unk> 
 Route 50 forms a concurrency with CR <unk> and the two routes head north and encounter the eastern terminus of Route 49 before leaving <unk> 
Not far after Route 49 , the road crosses the <unk> River into <unk> City , Atlantic County 
 In <unk> City , it heads into residential areas , with CR <unk> <unk> to the west of the route 
 Route 50 and CR <unk> continue northwest and intersect CR 648 , where the road turns north into more forested areas 
 At the junction with CR 645 , the route turns to the northeast and enters <unk> Manor , becoming Broad Street 
 CR <unk> splits from Route 50 by heading northwest on Buena <unk> Road and Route 50 heads through some agricultural <unk> concurrent with CR <unk> Truck , passing to the west of the <unk> Wildlife Area , which is known as a breeding ground for several species of birds 
 The route intersects CR <unk> , turning to the northeast 
US 40 and <unk> 50 follow the Harding Highway , a two @-@ lane undivided road , turning to the northeast and crossing the Great <unk> Harbor River 
 Upon passing over the river , enters Mays Landing and turns north , encountering CR <unk> before passing over an abandoned railroad line and heading into the downtown area of Mays Landing 
 Here , the road crosses CR <unk> , and US 40 splits from <unk> 50 by turning east along that road 
 Meanwhile , Route 50 continues north on Cape May Avenue , passing through developed areas 
 It leaves Mays Landing and heads into back into forests 
 The route turns to the northeast , passing near the <unk> Leaf Lakes residential development , before coming to an interchange with US 322 ( Black Horse Pike ) 
The portion of current Route 50 between <unk> and Petersburg received funding to become a spur of the Ocean Highway in 1910 
 The modern @-@ day alignment of Route 50 was legislated as part of pre @-@ 1927 Route 14 in 1917 , a route that was to run from Cape May to <unk> Harbor City 
 In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering , the portion of pre @-@ 1927 Route 14 between <unk> and <unk> Harbor City was designated as Route 50 , the highest state route number assigned in the renumbering 
 Route 50 retained its current routing in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering 
 A freeway was proposed for Route 50 around 1960 , running from the Garden State Parkway in Dennis Township north to US 30 in <unk> Township 
 This proposed freeway was intended to provide economic development to the region as well as provide a better route to the Jersey Shore resorts of Cape May County for travelers from the Delaware Valley 
 However , this freeway was canceled by the mid @-@ 1970s due to financial and environmental concerns as well as lack of traffic along Route 50 
 On November 21 , 2008 , construction began on making the interchange with the Atlantic City Expressway a full interchange as part of a series of improvements set for the Atlantic City Expressway 
 This project was completed on June 18 , 2010 
<unk> between <unk> and Prime Minister Ian Smith , which had been progressing <unk> , were immediately suspended by the furious <unk> , with Smith calling <unk> a " monster " 
 On 10 September , Smith announced the extension of martial law over selected areas 
 The Rhodesian Security Forces launched several retaliatory strikes into Zambia and Mozambique over the following months , attacking both <unk> and its rival , the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army ( ZANLA ) 
 The attack on <unk> in particular brought great controversy as many of those killed were refugees camping in and around guerrilla positions 
 Five months later , in February 1979 , <unk> shot down Air Rhodesia Flight <unk> , another civilian flight , in an almost identical incident 
After the security forces mounted a successful counter @-@ insurgency campaign during 1973 and 1974 , developments overseas caused the conflict 's momentum to shift in the insurgents ' favour 
 The leftist Carnation Revolution of April 1974 caused Portugal to withdraw its key economic support for Smith 's administration , and led to Mozambique 's independence the following year as a communist state openly allied with <unk> 
 Around the same time , Rhodesia 's other main <unk> , South Africa , adopted a <unk> initiative that forced a ceasefire , giving the guerrillas time to regroup 
 Following the abortive Victoria Falls Conference of August 1975 , Smith and the <unk> leader Joshua <unk> held unsuccessful talks between December 1975 and March 1976 
 <unk> and <unk> announced in October 1976 , during the run @-@ up to the unsuccessful Geneva Conference in December , that they would <unk> attend conferences as a joint " Patriotic Front " 
In March 1978 , Smith and non @-@ militant nationalist groups headed by Bishop <unk> <unk> , the Reverend <unk> <unk> and Chief Jeremiah <unk> agreed what became the " Internal Settlement " 
 This created a joint black – white transitional government , with the country due to be reconstituted as Zimbabwe Rhodesia in June 1979 , pursuant to <unk> elections 
 <unk> and <unk> were invited to participate , but refused ; <unk> <unk> dubbed Smith 's black colleagues " the blacksmiths " 
 <unk> proclaimed 1978 to be " The Year of the People " as the war continued 
 Officials from <unk> 's United African National Council , sent to the provinces to explain the Internal Settlement to rural blacks , were killed by Marxist – <unk> guerrillas 
 <unk> also began to target Christian missionaries , <unk> in the killing of nine British missionaries and four children at <unk> Mission near the Mozambican border on 23 June 
The transitional government was badly received abroad , partly because the Internal Settlement kept control of law enforcement , the military , the judiciary and the civil service under white control 
 No country recognised Rhodesia 's interim administration 
 Smith again worked to bring <unk> into the government , hoping this would lend it some <unk> domestically , prompt diplomatic recognition overseas , and help the security forces defeat ZANLA 
 Starting on 14 August 1978 , he attended secret meetings with <unk> in <unk> , Zambia ( where <unk> was based ) , doing so with the assistance of the mining corporation <unk> 
 Attempts were made to also involve the <unk> leader Robert <unk> , but <unk> would have no part in the talks 
 According to the South African military historian <unk> <unk> , negotiations between Smith and <unk> progressed well and " seemed on the verge of success " by the start of September 1978 
 On 2 September , Smith and <unk> revealed publicly that the secret meetings had taken place 
Rhodesian air traffic was not seriously threatened until about 1977 , in the latter stages of the war ; before this time , neither revolutionary force had the weapons to launch a viable attack against an aerial target 
 The weapon that made such attacks feasible for <unk> was the <unk> 2 shoulder @-@ launched surface @-@ to @-@ air missile launcher , supplied by the Soviet Union from the mid @-@ 1970s as part of the Warsaw Pact 's materiel support 
 By September 1978 , there had been 20 reported attempts to shoot down Rhodesian military aircraft using these weapons , none of which had been successful 
 Some Rhodesian Air Force Dakotas had been hit , but all had survived and landed safely 
 No civilian aircraft had yet been targeted during the Bush War 
A group of <unk> guerrillas , armed with a <unk> @-@ 2 launcher , waited in the bush beneath Flight <unk> 's <unk> , and fired on the <unk> about five minutes after it took off , while the aircraft was still in the climb phase of its flight 
 The heat @-@ seeking missile hit the plane 's starboard wing and exploded , causing the inner engine to also explode 
 A fuel tank and hydraulic lines <unk> , creating a fire that the passengers and crew could not put out 
 The second starboard engine failed almost immediately , leaving Hood with only his two port engines 
 <unk> wildly , the <unk> began to descend rapidly 
At 17 : 10 Captain Hood sent a distress call to air traffic control , informing them that he had lost the two starboard engines and was going to crash 
 " We 're going in , " he <unk> 
 <unk> his passengers to <unk> for an emergency landing , he aimed for an open field of cotton in the <unk> Hills , in the bush to the west of <unk> , intending to belly land the craft 
 The landing was relatively stable until the <unk> hit a previously unseen ditch , <unk> and exploded 
 The remaining fuel tanks <unk> and caught fire , setting the wrecked cabin <unk> 
Of the 56 people on board , 38 , including Hood and Beaumont , died in the crash 
 Eighteen survived , albeit with injuries , and climbed out of the wreckage 
 After briefly settling the others , one of the passengers , Dr Cecil <unk> , led four others — young <unk> Robert and Shannon <unk> , Mrs Sharon <unk> , and her four @-@ year @-@ old daughter Tracey — off in the direction of a nearby village in search of water 
 The other 13 remained close to the wreckage 
 Meanwhile , nine guerrillas made their way towards the crash site , and reached it at about 17 : 45 
 Three of the 13 survivors remaining at the crash site hid on seeing figures approaching : Rhodesian Army <unk> Anthony Hill , 39 , took cover in the surrounding bush , while businessman Hans Hansen and his wife Diana did the same 
 This left 10 passengers in full view near the wreckage , including four women and two girls ( aged 11 and 4 ) 
The guerrillas , who were armed with AK @-@ 47 rifles , presented themselves to the 10 passengers as friendly , saying they would summon help and bring water 
 They spoke in English , both to the survivors and among themselves 
 They told the passengers to <unk> around a point a few metres from the wreckage ; when the survivors said that some of them were too badly injured to walk , the insurgents told the able @-@ bodied men to carry the others 
 The passengers were assembled into an area of about 10 square metres ( 110 sq ft ) 
 Standing roughly 15 metres ( 49 ft ) away , the cadres now raised their weapons 
 " You have taken our land , " one of them said 
 " Please don 't shoot us ! " one of the passengers cried , just before they were killed by a sustained burst of automatic gunfire 
Having collected water from the nearby village , <unk> and his companions were almost back at the crash site when they heard the shots 
 <unk> it was personal ammunition in the luggage exploding in the heat , they continued on their way , and called out to the other passengers , who they thought were still alive 
 This alerted the insurgents to the presence of more survivors ; one of the guerrillas told <unk> 's group to " come here " 
 The insurgents then opened fire on their general location , prompting <unk> and the others to flee 
 Hill and the <unk> also ran ; they revealed their positions to the fighters in their <unk> , but successfully hid themselves behind a ridge 
 After Hill and the others had hidden there for about two hours , they saw the attackers return to the crash site at about 19 : 45 
 The guerrillas looted the wrecked cabin and some of the <unk> <unk> around the site , filled their arms with various passengers ' belongings , then left again 
According to <unk> <unk> , a professor and human rights speaker who wrote a history of <unk> , <unk> was implying that responsibility for the massacre actually lay with security force pseudo @-@ guerrillas , more specifically the mixed race <unk> Scouts unit , which had often been accused of <unk> rural civilians with the goal of shifting public opinion 
 <unk> asserts that the massacre " cannot be put beyond " the Scouts , and also supports <unk> 's claim that the <unk> had been used militarily , suggesting that <unk> might have believed there to be Rhodesian soldiers on board 
 " Rhodesian television , before attacks on ZANLA in Mozambique , had shown <unk> ferrying paratroopers for the job , " he writes , " 


 [ and ] <unk> intelligence knew there were paratroopers stationed [ at Victoria Falls ] " 
A report published in the American magazine Time a fortnight later described the incident as " a genuine horror story , calculated to make the most <unk> of Rhodesian <unk> <unk> seem true 
 " Indeed , the white community in Rhodesia heard the news with <unk> , and many turned their minds to exacting <unk> for what they and many others saw as an act of terrorism 
 The prominent Indian @-@ Rhodesian <unk> family was particularly affected by the incident , having lost eight members in the attack 
 Though Rhodesian authorities did not immediately acknowledge the cause of the crash , doing so only after four days ' investigation , the truth was common knowledge in Salisbury within hours 
 Smith wrote in his memoirs that the " degree of anger 


 [ was ] difficult to control " 
 White South Africans were similarly enraged , particularly after reports appeared in the South African press that the <unk> had raped the female passengers before <unk> them 
 A Friends of Rhodesia Society in South Africa offered a reward of <unk> to anybody who would either kill <unk> or bring him to Salisbury to stand trial 
Geoffrey <unk> , who was then one of the few black reporters at the Rhodesia Herald newspaper , later wrote in his memoirs that many whites became <unk> and wary towards blacks in general , believing them all to be " terrorist <unk> " 
 Describing the Herald <unk> the night of the incident , he relates a " <unk> collective temper " among the white sub @-@ editors : " They cursed until their voices became <unk> , threatening dire consequences for all <unk> and <unk> or <unk> 


 I <unk> that some of the more derogatory remarks made in <unk> loud voices that evening were meant specifically for my ears 
Several racially motivated incidents occurred over the following days 
 According to the Time article , a group of whites entered an <unk> Salisbury bar " fingering the <unk> of rifles " and forced blacks drinking there to leave 
 Time also reported a <unk> that two white youths , on learning of the massacre , shot the first black man they saw 
 Smith says that several would @-@ be <unk> groups sought his permission to venture into the bush around the crash site to " make the local people pay for their crime of <unk> and assisting the terrorists " 
 He instructed them not to , according to his memoirs , telling them that many rural blacks only assisted the guerrillas under extreme <unk> , and that it would not do to attack them 
 Many <unk> also resented the apparent lack of sympathy emanating from overseas governments , especially considering the character of the attack and its civilian target 
Dean John de Costa gave a sermon <unk> what he described as a " <unk> silence " from overseas 
 " Nobody who holds sacred the dignity of human life can be anything but <unk> at the events attending the Viscount , " he said 
 " But are we <unk> with the voice of protest from nations who call themselves <unk> ? We are not ! Like men in the story of the Good <unk> , they pass by on the other side 


 The <unk> of this ill @-@ <unk> flight from <unk> will be burnt upon our memories for years to come 
 For others , far from our borders , it is an intellectual matter , not one which affects them deeply 
Because <unk> and <unk> were based in Zambia , many <unk> <unk> for a massive retaliatory strike against terrorist targets in that country , but the first external target hit by the security forces following the Viscount <unk> was the prominent cluster of ZANLA bases around <unk> in Mozambique 
 The Rhodesian military had struck these bases extensively in November 1977 during Operation <unk> , destroying much of the ZANLA presence there , but the insurgents had since built a complex called " New <unk> " , slightly to the east ; the new camps were distributed across a far larger area than the originals 
 In a combined airborne @-@ ground assault called Operation <unk> , the Rhodesian Air Force , Rhodesian Light Infantry and Special Air Service wiped out much of New <unk> on 20 September 1978 
 Mozambique sent armour to ZANLA 's aid in the form of nine Soviet @-@ made T @-@ 54 tanks and four Russian <unk> @-@ 152 armoured personnel carriers , but the former were routed and one of the latter destroyed by the Rhodesian security forces 
 According to Rhodesian figures , there were " several hundred " guerrillas killed , while the security forces lost only two soldiers , one of whom was accidentally killed by a friendly air strike 
Rhodesia then attacked <unk> 's bases in Zambia , in what Group Captain Peter <unk> @-@ Bowyer later described as " <unk> time " for Flight <unk> 
 Operation <unk> , launched on 19 October 1978 , was another joint @-@ force operation between the Air Force and the Army , which contributed Special Air Service and Rhodesian Light Infantry paratroopers 
 <unk> 's primary target , just 16 kilometres ( 10 miles ) north @-@ east of central <unk> , was the formerly white @-@ owned <unk> Farm , which had been transformed into <unk> 's main headquarters and training base under the name " Freedom Camp " 
 <unk> presumed that Rhodesia would never <unk> to attack a site so close to <unk> 
 About 4 @,@ 000 guerrillas underwent training at Freedom Camp , with senior <unk> staff also on site 
 The Rhodesian operation 's other targets were <unk> , 19 kilometres ( 12 miles ) north of <unk> , and <unk> Camp ; all three were to be attacked more or less simultaneously in a coordinated sweep across Zambia 
 <unk> targets deep inside Zambia was a first for the Rhodesian forces ; previously only guerrillas near the border had been attacked 
Historians Paul <unk> and Peter <unk> write that this exaggerated considerably the actual number of guerrillas killed , as most of <unk> 's army , then numbering about 10 @,@ 000 fighters , had not been touched 
 On the other hand , unarmed refugees often camped in or around insurgent positions , and hundreds of these had been killed in the Rhodesian raid 
 <unk> and <unk> comment that for the Rhodesian airmen , it would have been " impossible to distinguish innocent refugees from young <unk> recruits 
 " <unk> describes Freedom Camp as " a refugee camp for boys " , and says " <unk> boys and girls " were killed 
 He claims that the Red Cross and the UN <unk> Agency " confirmed <unk> 's claim that Smith 's forces struck at <unk> , civilian <unk> " 
The Rhodesian attacks on ZANLA and <unk> bases did much to restore white morale following the Viscount incident , though they had not actually made much impact on the respective guerrilla campaigns 
 <unk> and the <unk> President Kenneth <unk> all the same requested further military aid and better weapons from the Soviets and the British respectively 
 Martial law was quickly extended across Rhodesia 's rural areas , and covered three @-@ quarters of the country by the end of 1978 
 Air Rhodesia , meanwhile , began developing anti @-@ <unk> shielding for its <unk> 
 Before this work was completed , <unk> shot down a second Viscount , Air Rhodesia Flight <unk> , on 12 February 1979 
 This time there were no survivors 
A British parliamentary motion put forward by Labour MP Kate <unk> in February 2013 to <unk> <unk> the Viscount attacks and <unk> the victims on the anniversary of the second <unk> prompted <unk> in the <unk> press , with the Herald branding it a racist " <unk> motion " intended to <unk> the <unk> administration and its supporters 
 <unk> <unk> , a former <unk> commander , described the move as a <unk> motivated by race that went against the spirit of the amnesty enacted at Lancaster House 
 Christopher <unk> , a diplomat and political analyst , took a similar line , calling <unk> 's proposed commemoration " a <unk> 


 [ that ] means they only regard the death of white people alone during the struggle 
 There is no mention of what happened to our sons and daughters in and outside the country 
 " <unk> 's official response to <unk> 's motion included the assertion that in all conflicts " civilians get caught up in cross @-@ fires due to faulty intelligence reports and other communication errors " , and juxtaposed the civilians killed in the Viscount <unk> with those killed at <unk> 
<unk> ( / <unk> / ) ( <unk> ’ al in modern <unk> <unk> ) is the ruins of an ancient city found in a <unk> in Guatemala 
 <unk> <unk> , a gum @-@ <unk> , reported the ruins to La <unk> , a <unk> newspaper , which named the site <unk> 
 After the Berlin Academy of Sciences ' magazine republished the report in 1853 , <unk> and treasure hunters began visiting the forest 
 Today tourism to the site may help protect the <unk> 
 It is one of the largest archaeological sites and urban centers of the pre @-@ Columbian Maya civilization 
 It is located in the archaeological region of the <unk> Basin in what is now northern Guatemala 
 Situated in the department of El <unk> , the site is part of Guatemala 's <unk> National Park and in 1979 it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site 
<unk> was the capital of a conquest state that became one of the most powerful kingdoms of the ancient Maya 
 Though monumental architecture at the site dates back as far as the 4th century BC , <unk> reached its <unk> during the Classic Period , c 
 200 to 900 AD 
 During this time , the city dominated much of the Maya region politically , economically , and militarily , while interacting with areas throughout <unk> such as the great metropolis of <unk> in the distant Valley of Mexico 
 There is evidence that <unk> was conquered by <unk> in the 4th century AD 
 Following the end of the Late Classic Period , no new major monuments were built at <unk> and there is evidence that elite palaces were burned 
 These events were coupled with a gradual population decline , culminating with the site ’ s abandonment by the end of the 10th century 
The name <unk> may be derived from <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> Maya language ; it is said to be a relatively modern name meaning " at the <unk> " 
 The name was apparently applied to one of the site 's ancient reservoirs by hunters and travelers in the region 
 It has alternatively been interpreted as meaning " the place of the voices " in the <unk> Maya language 
 <unk> , however , is not the ancient name for the site but rather the name adopted shortly after its discovery in the 1840s 
 <unk> inscriptions at the ruins refer to the ancient city as <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> , meaning " First <unk> " 
 <unk> may have come to have been called this because <unk> <unk> also came to use the same emblem glyph ; the rulers of the city presumably wanted to distinguish themselves as the first city to bear the name 
 The kingdom as a whole was simply called <unk> , which is the reading of the " hair bundle " emblem glyph seen in the accompanying photo 
 Its precise meaning remains obscure 
The city has been completely mapped and covered an area greater than 16 square kilometres ( 6 @
@ 2 sq mi ) that included about 3 @,@ 000 structures 
 The topography of the site consists of a series of parallel limestone ridges rising above swampy lowlands 
 The major architecture of the site is clustered upon areas of higher ground and linked by raised <unk> spanning the swamps 
 The area around <unk> has been declared as the <unk> National Park and the preserved area covers 570 square kilometres ( 220 sq mi ) 
The ruins lie among the tropical rainforests of northern Guatemala that formed the <unk> of lowland Maya civilization 
 The city itself was located among abundant fertile upland soils , and may have dominated a natural east – west trade route across the <unk> Peninsula 
 <unk> trees at the <unk> park include gigantic <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) the sacred tree of the Maya ; tropical cedar ( <unk> <unk> ) , and Honduras mahogany ( <unk> <unk> ) 
 Regarding the fauna , <unk> , white @-@ <unk> <unk> , gray foxes , <unk> 's spider monkeys , <unk> monkeys , <unk> eagles , falcons , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , green parrots and <unk> ants can be seen there regularly 
 <unk> , <unk> , and cougars are also said to <unk> in the park 
 For centuries this city was completely covered under jungle 
 The average annual rainfall at <unk> is 1 @,@ <unk> millimetres ( 76 @
@ 6 in ) 
The population of <unk> began a continuous curve of growth starting in the <unk> Period ( approximately 2000 BC – AD 200 ) , with a peak in the Late Classic with the population growing rapidly from AD 700 through to 830 , followed by a sharp decline 
 For the 120 square kilometres ( 46 sq mi ) area falling within the <unk> defenses of the hinterland , the peak population is estimated at <unk> per square kilometer ( <unk> per square mile ) 
 In an area within a 12 kilometres ( 7 @
@ 5 mi ) radius of the site core , peak population is estimated at 120 @,@ 000 ; population density is estimated at 265 per square kilometer ( <unk> per square mile ) 
 In a region within a 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) radius of the site core and including some satellite sites , peak population is estimated at 425 @,@ 000 with a density of 216 per square kilometer ( 515 per square mile ) 
 These population figures are even more impressive because of the extensive <unk> that were unsuitable for habitation or agriculture 
 However , some archaeologists , such as David Webster , believe these figures to be far too high 
The fourteenth king of <unk> was <unk> <unk> Ich 'aak ( Great Jaguar <unk> ) 
 <unk> <unk> Ich 'aak built a palace that was preserved and developed by later rulers until it became the core of the Central Acropolis 
 Little is known about <unk> <unk> Ich 'aak except that he was killed on 14 January <unk> AD 
 On the same day , <unk> K ’ <unk> ’ ( Fire Is Born ) arrived from the west , having passed through El Peru , a site to the west of <unk> , on 8 January 
 On Stela 31 he is named as " Lord of the West " 
 <unk> K ’ <unk> ’ was probably a foreign general serving a figure represented by a non @-@ Maya <unk> of a <unk> combined with an owl , a glyph that is well known from the great metropolis of <unk> in the distant Valley of Mexico 
 <unk> Owl may even have been the ruler of <unk> 
 These recorded events strongly suggest that <unk> K ’ <unk> ’ led a <unk> invasion that defeated the native <unk> king , who was captured and immediately executed 
 <unk> K <unk> ' appears to have been aided by a powerful political faction at <unk> itself ; roughly at the time of the conquest , a group of <unk> natives were apparently residing near the Lost World complex 
 He also exerted control over other cities in the area , including <unk> , where he became king , but did not take the throne of <unk> for himself 
 Within a year , the son of <unk> Owl by the name of <unk> <unk> <unk> I ( First Crocodile ) had been installed as the tenth king of <unk> while he was still a boy , being enthroned on 13 September <unk> 
 He reigned for 47 years as king of <unk> , and remained a vassal of <unk> K <unk> ' for as long as the latter lived 
 It seems likely that <unk> <unk> <unk> I took a wife from the <unk> , defeated , <unk> dynasty and thus <unk> the right to rule of his son , <unk> Chan K 'awiil II 
Although the new rulers of <unk> were foreign , their descendants were rapidly <unk> 
 <unk> became the key ally and trading partner of <unk> in the Maya lowlands 
 After being conquered by <unk> , <unk> rapidly dominated the northern and eastern <unk> 
 <unk> , together with smaller towns in the region , were absorbed into <unk> 's kingdom 
 Other sites , such as <unk> and <unk> de San José near Lake <unk> <unk> became vassals of their more powerful neighbor to the north 
 By the middle of the 5th century <unk> had a core territory of at least 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) in every direction 
In the 5th century the power of the city reached as far south as <unk> , whose founder K 'inich <unk> K <unk> ' Mo ' was clearly connected with <unk> 
 <unk> itself was not in an ethnically Maya region and the founding of the <unk> dynasty probably involved the direct intervention of <unk> 
 K 'inich <unk> K <unk> ' Mo ' arrived in <unk> in December 426 and bone analysis of his remains shows that he passed his childhood and youth at <unk> 
 An individual known as <unk> K <unk> ' Mo ' ( lord K <unk> ' Mo ' ) is referred to in an early text at <unk> and may well be the same person 
 His tomb had <unk> characteristics and he was depicted in later portraits dressed in the warrior <unk> of <unk> 
 <unk> texts refer to him as " Lord of the West " , much like <unk> K ’ <unk> ’ 
 At the same time , in late 426 , <unk> founded the nearby site of <unk> , possibly sponsored by <unk> itself 
 The founding of these two centers may have been part of an effort to impose <unk> 's authority upon the southeastern portion of the Maya region 
 The interaction between these sites and <unk> was intense over the next three centuries 
The early 6th century saw another queen ruling the city , known only as the " Lady of <unk> " , who was very likely a daughter of <unk> <unk> Ich 'aak II 
 She seems never to have ruled in her own right , rather being partnered with male co @-@ rulers 
 The first of these was <unk> ' B <unk> , who seems to have had a long career as a general at <unk> before becoming co @-@ ruler and 19th in the dynastic sequence 
 The Lady of <unk> herself seems not have been counted in the dynastic numbering 
 It appears she was later paired with lord " Bird Claw " , who is presumed to be the otherwise unknown 20th ruler 
 
In the mid 6th century , <unk> seems to have allied with <unk> and defeated <unk> , closing the Early Classic 
 The " <unk> hiatus " refers to a period between the late 6th to late 7th century where there was a lapse in the writing of inscriptions and large @-@ scale construction at <unk> 
 In the latter half of the 6th century AD , a serious crisis <unk> the city , with no new stelae being erected and with widespread deliberate mutilation of public sculpture 
 This hiatus in activity at <unk> was long unexplained until later <unk> <unk> identified that the period was prompted by <unk> 's comprehensive defeat at the hands of <unk> and the <unk> polity in AD 562 , a defeat that seems to have resulted in the capture and sacrifice of the king of <unk> 
 The badly eroded Altar 21 at <unk> described how <unk> suffered this disastrous defeat in a major war in April 562 
 It seems that <unk> was an ally of <unk> in the wider conflict between that city and <unk> , with the defeat of <unk> having a lasting impact upon the city 
 <unk> was not sacked but its power and influence were broken 
 After its great victory , <unk> grew rapidly and some of <unk> 's population may have been forcibly relocated there 
 During the hiatus period , at least one ruler of <unk> took refuge with <unk> ' <unk> of Palenque , another of <unk> 's victims 
 <unk> itself <unk> during <unk> 's long hiatus period 
In <unk> <unk> founded <unk> <unk> , some 110 kilometres ( 68 mi ) to the southwest , as a military outpost in order to control trade along the course of the <unk> River 
 B <unk> Chan K 'awiil was installed on the throne of the new outpost at the age of four , in 635 , and for many years served as a loyal vassal fighting for his brother , the king of <unk> 
 Roughly twenty years later <unk> <unk> was attacked by <unk> and was soundly defeated 
 B <unk> Chan K 'awiil was captured by the king of <unk> but , instead of being sacrificed , he was re @-@ instated on his throne as a vassal of his former enemy , and attacked <unk> in <unk> , forcing <unk> <unk> Chaak , the then king of <unk> , to temporarily abandon the city 
 The first two rulers of <unk> <unk> continued to use the <unk> emblem glyph of <unk> , and they probably felt that they had a legitimate claim to the throne of <unk> itself 
 For some reason , B <unk> Chan K 'awiil was not installed as the new ruler of <unk> ; instead he stayed at <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> against <unk> <unk> in <unk> , driving B <unk> Chan K 'awiil into an exile that lasted five years 
 <unk> tried to encircle <unk> within an area dominated by its allies , such as El Peru , <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
By the 9th century , the crisis of the Classic Maya collapse was sweeping across the region , with populations <unk> and city after city falling into silence 
 Increasingly endemic warfare in the Maya region caused <unk> 's supporting population to heavily concentrate close to the city itself , accelerating the use of intensive agriculture and corresponding environmental decline 
 Construction continued at the beginning of the century , with the erection of Temple 3 , the last of the city 's major pyramids and the erection of monuments to mark the 19th K <unk> in <unk> 
 The beginning of the 10th <unk> <unk> in 830 passed <unk> , and marks the beginning of a 60 @-@ year hiatus , probably resulting from the collapse of central control in the city 
 During this hiatus , satellite sites traditionally under <unk> 's control began to erect their own monuments featuring local rulers and using the <unk> emblem glyph , with <unk> apparently lacking the authority or the power to crush these bids for independence 
 In <unk> , <unk> K 'awiil is mentioned on a stela at <unk> as visiting that city as the Divine Lord of <unk> but he is not recorded elsewhere and <unk> 's once great power was little more than a memory 
 The sites of <unk> and <unk> had by now inherited the once exclusive <unk> emblem glyph 
In the latter half of the 9th century there was an attempt to revive royal power at the much diminished city of <unk> , as evidenced by a stela erected in the Great Plaza by <unk> Chan K 'awiil II in <unk> 
 This was the last monument erected at <unk> before the city finally fell into silence 
 The former satellites of <unk> , such as <unk> and <unk> , did not last much longer , <unk> their final monuments in <unk> 
 By the end of the 9th century the vast majority of <unk> 's population had deserted the city , its royal palaces were occupied by squatters and simple <unk> dwellings were being erected in the city 's ceremonial <unk> 
 The squatters blocked some <unk> in the rooms they <unk> in the monumental structures of the site and left rubbish that included a mixture of domestic refuse and non @-@ <unk> items such as musical instruments 
 These inhabitants reused the earlier monuments for their own ritual activities far removed from those of the royal dynasty that had erected them 
 Some monuments were <unk> and some were moved to new locations 
 Before its final abandonment all respect for the old rulers had disappeared , with the tombs of the North Acropolis being explored for <unk> and the easier to find tombs being looted 
 After 950 , <unk> was all but deserted , although a remnant population may have survived in <unk> <unk> interspersed among the ruins 
 Even these final inhabitants abandoned the city in the 10th or 11th centuries and the <unk> claimed the ruins for the next thousand years 
 Some of <unk> 's population may have migrated to the <unk> Lakes region , which remained heavily populated in spite of a <unk> in population levels in the first half of the 9th century 
As is often the case with huge ancient ruins , knowledge of the site was never completely lost in the region 
 It seems that local people never <unk> about <unk> and they guided <unk> expeditions to the ruins in the 1850s 
 Some second- or third @-@ hand accounts of <unk> appeared in print starting in the 17th century , continuing through the writings of John Lloyd Stephens in the early 19th century ( Stephens and his illustrator Frederick <unk> heard rumors of a lost city , with white building tops towering above the jungle , during their 1839 @-@ 40 travels in the region ) 
 Because of the site 's <unk> from modern towns , however , no explorers visited <unk> until <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , respectively the commissioner and the governor of <unk> , visited it in 1848 
 Artist <unk> <unk> accompanied them and their account was published in Germany in 1853 
 Several other expeditions came to further investigate , map , and photograph <unk> in the 19th century ( including Alfred P
 <unk> in 1881 @-@ 82 ) and the early 20th century 
 <unk> archaeologists started to clear , map and record the ruins in the 1880s 
In 1951 , a small airstrip was built at the ruins , which previously could only be reached by several days ' travel through the jungle on foot or mule 
 In 1956 the <unk> project began to map the city on a scale not previously seen in the Maya area 
 From 1956 through 1970 , major archaeological excavations were carried out by the University of Pennsylvania <unk> Project 
 They mapped much of the site and excavated and restored many of the structures 
 Excavations directed by Edwin M
 <unk> and later by William Coe of the university investigated the North Acropolis and the Central Plaza from 1957 to 1969 
 The <unk> Project recorded over 200 monuments at the site 
 In 1979 , the <unk> government began a further archeological project at <unk> , which continued through to 1984 
<unk> has been partially restored by the University of Pennsylvania and the government of Guatemala 
 It was one of the largest of the Classic period Maya cities and was one of the largest cities in the Americas 
 The architecture of the ancient city is built from limestone and includes the remains of temples that tower over 70 metres ( 230 ft ) high , large royal palaces , in addition to a number of smaller pyramids , palaces , residences , administrative buildings , platforms and inscribed stone monuments 
 There is even a building which seemed to have been a jail , originally with wooden bars across the windows and doors 
 There are also seven courts for playing the <unk> <unk> , including a set of 3 in the Seven Temples Plaza , a unique feature in <unk> 
The residential area of <unk> covers an estimated 60 square kilometres ( 23 sq mi ) , much of which has not yet been cleared , mapped , or excavated 
 A huge set of earthworks discovered by Dennis E
 <unk> and Donald <unk> in the 1960s rings <unk> with a 6 @-@ metre ( 20 ft ) wide trench behind a rampart 
 The 16 square kilometres ( 6 @
@ 2 sq mi ) area around the site core has been intensively mapped ; it may have enclosed an area of some 125 square kilometres ( 48 sq mi ) ( see below ) 
 Population estimates place the demographic size of the site between 10 @,@ 000 and 90 @,@ 000 , and possibly 425 @,@ 000 in the surrounding area 
 Recently , a project exploring the defensive earthworks has shown that the scale of the earthworks is highly variable and that in many places it is <unk> as a defensive feature 
 In addition , some parts of the <unk> were integrated into a canal system 
 The <unk> of <unk> varies significantly in coverage from what was originally proposed and it is much more complex and <unk> than originally thought 
By the Late Classic , a network of <unk> ( <unk> ) linked various parts of the city , running for several kilometres through its urban core 
 These linked the Great Plaza with Temple 4 ( located about 750 metres ( 2 @,@ 460 ft ) to the west ) and the Temple of the <unk> ( about 1 kilometre ( 0 @
@ 62 mi ) to the southeast ) 
 These broad <unk> were built of packed and plastered limestone and have been named after early explorers and archaeologists ; the Maler , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 They assisted the passage everyday traffic during the rain season and also served as dams 
The North Acropolis , together with the Great Plaza immediately to the south , is one of the most studied architectural groups in the Maya area ; the <unk> Project excavated a massive trench across the complex , thoroughly investigating its construction history 
 It is a complex group with construction beginning in the <unk> Period , around 350 BC 
 It developed into a funerary complex for the ruling dynasty of the Classic Period , with each additional royal burial adding new temples on top of the older structures 
 After AD 400 a row of tall pyramids was added to the earlier Northern Platform , which measured 100 by 80 metres ( 330 by 260 ft ) , gradually hiding it from view 
 Eight temple pyramids were built in the 6th century AD , each of them had an elaborate <unk> and a stairway flanked by masks of the gods 
 By the 9th century AD , 43 stelae and 30 altars had been erected in the North Acropolis ; 18 of these monuments were carved with hieroglyphic texts and royal portraits 
 The North Acropolis continued to receive burials into the <unk> Period 
The Mundo <unk> is to the west of the Plaza of the Seven Temples 
 It is the largest ceremonial complex dating from the <unk> period at <unk> 
 The complex was organized as a large E @-@ Group consisting of a pyramid aligned with a platform to the east that supported three temples 
 The Mundo <unk> complex was rebuilt many times over the course of its history 
 By AD 250 – 300 its architectural style was influenced by the great metropolis of <unk> in the Valley of Mexico , including the use of the <unk> @-@ <unk> form 
 During the Early Classic period ( c 
 250 – 600 ) the Mundo <unk> became one of the twin <unk> of the city , the other being the North Acropolis 
 From AD 250 to <unk> it may have served as the royal necropolis 
 The Mundo <unk> complex was given its name by the archaeologists of the University of Pennsylvania ; it is centered upon the Lost World Pyramid and a small platform to the west of it 
Group G lies just south of the <unk> Causeway 
 The complex dates to the Late Classic and consists of palace @-@ type structures and is one of the largest groups of its type at <unk> 
 It has two stories but most of the rooms are on the lower floor , a total of 29 vaulted chambers 
 The remains of two further chambers belong to the upper storey 
 One of the entrances to the group was framed by a gigantic mask 
There are nine Twin @-@ Pyramid <unk> at <unk> , one of which was completely dismantled in ancient times and some others were partly destroyed 
 They vary in size but consist of two pyramids facing each other on an east – west axis 
 These pyramids are flat @-@ topped and have <unk> on all four sides 
 A row of plain stelae is placed immediately to the west of the eastern pyramid and to the north of the pyramids , and lying roughly <unk> from them , there is usually a sculpted stela and altar pair 
 On the south side of these complexes there is a long vaulted building containing a single room with nine <unk> 
 The entire complex was built at once and these complexes were built at 20 @-@ year ( or k <unk> ) intervals during the Late Classic 
 The first twin pyramid complex was built in the early 6th century in the East Plaza 
 It was once thought that these complexes were unique to <unk> but rare examples have now been found at other sites , such as <unk> and <unk> , and they may reflect the extent of <unk> 's political dominance in the Late Classic 
There are thousands of ancient structures at <unk> and only a fraction of these have been excavated , after decades of archaeological work 
 The most prominent surviving buildings include six very large pyramids , labelled Temples I - VI , each of which support a temple structure on their <unk> 
 Some of these pyramids are over 60 metres ( 200 feet ) high 
 They were numbered <unk> during the early survey of the site 
 It is estimated that each of these major temples could have been built in as little as two years 
Temple I ( also known as the Temple of <unk> <unk> or Temple of the Great Jaguar ) is a funerary pyramid dedicated to <unk> Chan K <unk> , who was <unk> in the structure in AD <unk> , the pyramid was completed around 740 – 750 
 The temple rises 47 metres ( 154 ft ) high 
 The massive <unk> that topped the temple was originally decorated with a giant sculpture of the enthroned king , although little of this decoration survives 
 The tomb of the king was discovered by Aubrey <unk> of the University of Pennsylvania in 1962 
 Among items recovered from the Late Classic tomb were a large collection of inscribed human and animal bone tubes and strips with sophisticated scenes depicting deities and people , finely carved and rubbed with <unk> , as well as <unk> and shell ornaments and ceramic vessels filled with offerings of food and drink 
 The shrine at the summit of the pyramid has three chambers , each behind the next , with the <unk> spanned by wooden <unk> fashioned from multiple beams 
 The outermost <unk> is plain but the two inner <unk> were carved , some of the beams were removed in the 19th century and their location is unknown , while others were taken to museums in Europe 
Temple II ( also known as the Temple of the Mask ) it was built around AD 700 and stands 38 metres ( 125 ft ) high 
 Like other major temples at <unk> , the summit shrine had three consecutive chambers with the <unk> spanned by wooden <unk> , only the middle of which was carved 
 The temple was dedicated to the wife of <unk> Chan K <unk> , although no tomb was found 
 The queen 's portrait was carved into the <unk> spanning the doorway of the summit shrine 
 One of the beams from this <unk> is now in the American Museum of Natural History in New York 
Temple IV is the tallest temple @-@ pyramid at <unk> , measuring 70 metres ( 230 ft ) from the plaza floor level to the top of its roof comb 
 Temple IV marks the reign of <unk> ’ in Chan <unk> ( Ruler B , the son of Ruler A or <unk> Chan K 'awiil I ) and two carved wooden <unk> over the doorway that leads into the temple on the pyramid ’ s summit record a long count date ( 9 @
@ 15 @
@ 10 @
@ 0 @
@ 0 ) that corresponds to CE <unk> ( <unk> 1994 : 169 ) 
 Temple IV is the largest pyramid built anywhere in the Maya region in the 8th century , and as it currently stands is the tallest pre @-@ Columbian structure in the Americas although the Pyramid of the Sun at <unk> may originally have been taller , as may have been one of the structures at El <unk> 
Temple 33 was a funerary pyramid erected over the tomb of <unk> Chan K 'awiil I ( known as <unk> 48 ) in the North Acropolis 
 It started life in the Early Classic as a wide basal platform decorated with large stucco masks that flanked the stairway 
 Later in the Early Classic a new superstructure was added , with its own masks and decorated panels 
 During the Hiatus a third stage was built over the earlier constructions , the stairway was demolished and another royal burial , of an unidentified ruler , was set into the structure ( <unk> 23 ) 
 While the new pyramid was being built another high ranking tomb ( <unk> 24 ) was inserted into the rubble core of the building 
 The pyramid was then completed , standing 33 metres ( 108 ft ) tall 
 The final version of Temple 33 was completely dismantled by archaeologists in 1965 in order to arrive at the earlier stages of construction 
Structure <unk> @-@ 43 is an unusual radial temple in the East Plaza , built over a pre @-@ existing twin pyramid complex 
 It is built into the end of the East Plaza Ballcourt and possessed four entry <unk> and three <unk> , the fourth ( south ) side was too close to the Central Acropolis for a stairway on that side 
 The building has a <unk> @-@ <unk> platform profile , modified from the original style found at <unk> 
 In fact , it has been suggested that the style of the building has closer <unk> with El <unk> and <unk> than with <unk> itself 
 The vertical <unk> panels are set between sloping <unk> panels and are decorated with paired disc symbols 
 Large flower symbols are set into the sloping <unk> panels , related to the Venus and star symbols used at <unk> 
 The roof of the structure was decorated with <unk> although only fragments now remain , showing a monstrous face , perhaps that of a jaguar , with another head emerging from the mouth 
 The second head possesses a <unk> tongue but is probably not that of a snake 
 The temple , and its associated ballcourt , probably date to the reign of <unk> <unk> Chaak or that of his son <unk> Chan K 'awiil I , in the later part of the 7th century 
The Lost World Pyramid ( Structure <unk> @-@ 54 ) is the largest structure in the Mundo <unk> complex 
 It lies in the southwest portion of <unk> ’ s central core , south of Temple III and west of Temple V
 It was decorated with stucco masks of the sun god and dates to the Late <unk> ; this pyramid is part of an enclosed complex of structures that remained intact and un @-@ impacted by later building activity at <unk> 
 By the end of the Late <unk> this pyramid was one of the largest structures in the Maya region 
 It attained its final form during the reign of <unk> <unk> Ich 'aak in the 4th century AD , in the Early Classic , standing more than 30 metres ( 98 ft ) high with <unk> on all four sides and a flat top that possibly supported a superstructure built from <unk> materials 
 Although the plaza later suffered significant alteration , the organization of a group of temples on the east side of this complex <unk> to the layout that defines the so @-@ called E @-@ Groups , identified as solar observatories 
Stela 4 is dated to AD <unk> , during the reign of <unk> <unk> <unk> after the intrusion of <unk> in the Maya area 
 The stela displays a mix of Maya and <unk> qualities , and deities from both cultures 
 It has a portrait of the king with the <unk> Jaguar God under one arm and the Mexican <unk> under the other 
 His helmet is a simplified version of the <unk> War <unk> 
 Unusually for Maya sculpture , but typically for <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> is depicted with a frontal face , rather than in profile 
Stela 29 bears a Long Count ( 8 @
@ 12 @
@ 14 @
@ 8 @
@ 15 ) date equivalent to AD <unk> , the earliest surviving Long Count date from the Maya lowlands 
 The stela is also the earliest monument to bear the <unk> emblem glyph 
 It bears a sculpture of the king facing to the right , holding the head of an underworld jaguar god , one of the patron deities of the city 
 The stela was deliberately smashed during the 6th century or some time later , the upper portion was dragged away and dumped in a rubbish tip close to Temple III , to be uncovered by archaeologists in 1959 
Stela 31 is the accession monument of <unk> Chan K 'awiil II , also bearing two portraits of his father , <unk> <unk> <unk> , as a youth dressed as a <unk> warrior 
 He carries a <unk> in one hand and bears a shield decorated with the face of <unk> , the <unk> war god 
 In ancient times the sculpture was broken and the upper portion was moved to the summit of Temple 33 and <unk> buried 
 Stela 31 has been described as the greatest Early Classic sculpture to survive at <unk> 
 A long hieroglyphic text is carved onto the back of the monument , the longest to survive from the Early Classic , which describes the arrival of <unk> K <unk> ' at El Peru and <unk> in January <unk> 
 It was also the first stela at <unk> to be carved on all four faces 
Stela 39 is a broken monument that was erected in the Lost World complex 
 The upper portion of the stela is missing but the lower portion shows the lower body and legs of <unk> <unk> Ich 'aak , holding a flint axe in his left hand 
 He is <unk> the figure of a bound , richly dressed captive 
 The monument is dated to AD <unk> 
 The text on the back of the monument describes a <unk> ritual to celebrate a <unk> @-@ ending 
 The stela also names <unk> <unk> Ich 'aak I 's father as K 'inich <unk> <unk> 
<unk> 10 is the tomb of <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 It is located beneath Structure 34 in the North Acropolis 
 The tomb contained a rich array of offerings , including ceramic vessels and food , and nine youths were sacrificed to accompany the dead king 
 A dog was also <unk> with the deceased king 
 <unk> in the tomb were <unk> and painted and many demonstrated a blend of Maya and <unk> styles 
 Among the offerings was an incense @-@ <unk> in the shape of an elderly underworld god , sitting on a stool made of human bones and holding a severed head in his hands 
 The tomb was sealed with a <unk> vault , then the pyramid was built on top 
<unk> 48 is generally accepted as the tomb of <unk> Chan K <unk> 
 It is located beneath Temple 33 in the North Acropolis 
 The chamber of the tomb was cut from the bedrock and contained the remains of the king himself together with those of two <unk> who had been sacrificed in order to accompany the deceased ruler 
 The walls of the tomb were covered with white stucco painted with hieroglyphs that included the Long Count date equivalent to 20 March 457 , probably the date of either the death or interment of the king 
 The king 's skeleton was missing its skull , its <unk> and one of its hands while the skeletons of the sacrificial victims were intact 
<unk> 85 dates to the Late <unk> and was enclosed by a platform , with a primitive <unk> vault 
 The tomb contained a single male skeleton , which lacked a skull and its <unk> 
 The dynastic founder of <unk> , <unk> <unk> ' Xook , has been linked to this tomb , which lies deep in the heart of the North Acropolis 
 The deceased had probably died in battle with his body being <unk> by his enemies before being recovered and interred by his followers 
 The bones were wrapped carefully in textiles to form an upright bundle 
 The missing head was replaced by a small <unk> mask with shell @-@ <unk> teeth and eyes and bearing a three @-@ pointed royal <unk> 
 This head wears an emblem of rulership on its forehead and is a rare <unk> lowland Maya portrait of a king 
 Among the contents of the tomb were a stingray spine , a <unk> shell and twenty @-@ six ceramic vessels 
<unk> 116 is the tomb of <unk> Chan K 'awiil I
 It is a large vaulted chamber deep within the pyramid , below the level of the Great Plaza 
 The tomb contained rich offerings of <unk> , ceramics , shell and works of art 
 The body of the king was covered with large quantities of <unk> ornaments including an enormous necklace with especially large beads , as depicted in sculpted portraits of the king 
 One of the outstanding pieces recovered from the tomb was an ornate <unk> mosaic vessel with the <unk> bearing a sculpted portrait of the king himself 
Tropical Storm <unk> was the tenth tropical storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season 
 <unk> developed out of a strong tropical wave which moved off the African coast on August 31 
 The wave quickly became organized and was declared Tropical Depression Ten while located 170 mi ( 270 km ) to the south @-@ southeast of the Cape Verde Islands on September 2 
 The depression was quickly upgraded to Tropical Storm <unk> around noon the same day 
 Over the next several days , <unk> moved in a general west @-@ northwest direction and reached its peak intensity early on September 3 
 Strong wind shear , some due to the outflow of Hurricane Ike , and dry air caused the storm to weaken 
 On September 6 , the combination of wind shear , dry air , and cooling waters caused <unk> to weaken into a tropical depression 
 <unk> deteriorated into a remnant low shortly after as convection continued to dissipate around the storm 
 The low ultimately dissipated while located 520 mi ( 835 km ) east of <unk> on September 10 
 However , the remnant moisture led to minor flooding on the island of St
 Croix 
Tropical Storm <unk> formed as a tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of Africa near the end of August 2008 
 It tracked south of Cape Verde and slowly developed , and on September 2 the disturbance became Tropical Depression Ten while located south @-@ southeast of the Cape Verde islands 
 As the depression became more organized , an eye @-@ like feature developed in the upper levels of the system 
 The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm <unk> six hours after forming 
 <unk> was located in an area which was supportive for rapid intensification but was not forecast to intensify quickly 
<unk> continued to intensify throughout the afternoon as the storm became more symmetrical 
 However , due to the location of the storm , there was a lack of accurate wind speed readings , and the National Hurricane Center was uncertain of its actual intensity 
 Despite the lack of wind shear around the storm , the center became slightly exposed and ceased further intensification 
 The storm was also heading into an area where shear was <unk> to significantly increase due to an upper @-@ level trough diving southward 
 Despite convection being partially removed from the center of <unk> , the storm intensified slightly in the early morning hours on September 3 as thunderstorm activity to the south of the center became more organized 
 The intensification was forecast to be short in duration as the trough to the north was deepening , causing the wind shear to the west to become stronger 
<unk> reached its peak intensity of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) around 8 a
m
 ( <unk> ) as it continued to become more organized 
 However , there were indications that it had already begun to weaken 
 <unk> towards the north was becoming restricted and arc clouds began emanating from the storm , a sign that dry air was entering the system 
 During the afternoon hours , the structure of <unk> began to rapidly deteriorate as strong wind shear and dry air took their toll 
 By the late night , the center was almost completely exposed and only a band of convection persisted near the center 
Despite continuing effects from the strong wind shear , a large , deep burst of convection formed in the northern <unk> of <unk> 
 The center was found to have shifted towards the new convection leading to an increase in intensity 
 The forecast showed a slight decrease in wind shear as <unk> continued westward and no change in intensity over the 5 @-@ day forecast was predicted 
 However , the convection decreased once more and the low became completely exposed by the late morning hours and <unk> weakened again 
 By the afternoon , the center of <unk> was only a <unk> of clouds , devoid of convection 
 During the overnight hours on September 4 into the morning of September 5 , convection associated with <unk> began to <unk> somewhat , mostly to the north of the circulation , due to the strong <unk> wind shear 
 By mid @-@ morning , <unk> re @-@ intensified slightly due to the redevelopment of some convection 
 However , the redevelopment was short lived and wind shear again took its toll on <unk> by late morning 
 The convection around the system became <unk> from the center and <unk> weakened slightly 
The weakening trend continued through the afternoon as the storm was being affected by strong <unk> shear 
 <unk> became almost fully devoid of any convection by mid @-@ afternoon and the storm weakened to 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) , barely holding on to tropical storm status 
 <unk> regained a small amount of convection in the late night hours , but not enough to still be classified a tropical storm 
 Due to the lack of convection , <unk> was downgraded to a Tropical Depression at <unk> ( <unk> ) with winds of 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) 
 Since there was no convection around the system , it would have normally been classified a remnant low but , due to the possibility of the storm <unk> over the next several days , it was considered a tropical depression 
 The next morning , <unk> was downgraded to a remnant low as strong wind shear and dry air caused the demise of the storm 
 No redevelopment was expected with <unk> as it began to move over colder waters and remain under strong wind shear until it dissipated 
However , the remnant low associated with <unk> began to show signs of redevelopment during the afternoon on September 7 
 <unk> around the system increased significantly and the low was no longer exposed 
 On September 8 , wind shear took over the system again 
 <unk> around the remnant low was torn away and the low was exposed once more 
 The National Hurricane Center did not state the chance of regeneration once the low became exposed 
 Finally , on September 9 , wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of <unk> deteriorating into an open wave 
 However , on September 10 , the remnants of <unk> redeveloped and global models picked up on the reformed system 
 Once more , the chance of regeneration was possible as the remnants of <unk> headed towards the Bahamas 
 However , on September 14 , dry air and wind shear caused the remnants to dissipate entirely 
Several days after the low dissipated , the remnant moisture from <unk> brought showers and thunderstorms to St
 Croix where up to 1 in ( 25 @
@ 4 mm ) of rain fell 
 The heavy rains led to minor street flooding and some urban flooding 
 No known damage was caused by the flood 
Mount <unk> is the highest summit of the Rocky Mountains of North America and the highest point in the U
S
 state of Colorado and the entire Mississippi River drainage basin 
 The ultra @-@ prominent 14 @,@ 440 @-@ foot ( <unk> @
@ 2 m ) <unk> is the highest peak in the <unk> Range and the second @-@ highest summit in the contiguous United States after Mount Whitney 
 Mount <unk> is located in San Isabel National Forest , 12 @
@ 1 miles ( 19 @
@ 4 km ) southwest ( bearing 223 ° ) of the City of <unk> in Lake County , Colorado 
The mountain was named in honor of Colorado statesman Samuel <unk> <unk> , who was active in the formative period of the state and Governor of the Territory of Colorado from 1873 to 1874 
 Henry W
 <unk> of the <unk> Survey was the first to record an ascent of the peak , in 1874 
 The <unk> and most popular climbing routes are categorized as Class 1 to 2 or A + in <unk> <unk> 
 Mount <unk> is therefore often referred to as the " gentle giant " that tops all others in the Rocky Mountains 
Mount <unk> is visible to the southwest of <unk> , often snow @-@ capped even in the summer 
 Many other <unk> surround <unk> in all directions , and it is very close to central Colorado 's Collegiate <unk> 
 The neighboring Mount Massive , to the north , is the second @-@ highest peak in the Rocky Mountains and the third @-@ highest in the contiguous United States , and La Plata Peak , to the south , is the fifth @-@ highest in the Rockies 
 The community of Twin Lakes lies at the base of Mount <unk> , Denver is about 130 miles ( <unk> km ) to the east , <unk> is 50 miles ( 80 km ) to the north , and <unk> is 40 miles ( 64 km ) to the west 
 <unk> , about 16 miles ( 26 km ) to the northeast , is the nearest large town 
 <unk> 's parent peak is Mount Whitney in California 
 Including Alaska and Hawaii , Mount <unk> is the fourteenth @-@ highest mountain in the United States 
Mount <unk> is part of the <unk> Range , an <unk> of the Laramide <unk> which separated from the Mosquito Range to the east around 28 million years ago 
 The tops of this range were heavily <unk> , leaving behind characteristic summit features and other such clues 
 For example , the base of <unk> on the eastern side exhibits large igneous and <unk> rocks deposited when the glaciers <unk> , which lie on a lateral <unk> 
 Further up the eastern side there is a large <unk> with a small <unk> 
 There are also lakes to both the north and south , <unk> and Twin Lakes respectively ; the Twin Lakes are a result of the natural dam of end moraines , and <unk> Lake was created by the <unk> Sugar <unk> Dam 
Mount <unk> is composed largely of <unk> 
 However , the summit ridge consists of <unk> basement rock , which is Pre @-@ <unk> in origin and about 1 @
@ 7 billion years old 
 There are various igneous <unk> including <unk> , as well as " bands " of <unk> and <unk> 
 Unlike mountains of similar altitude elsewhere , <unk> lacks both a permanent <unk> and a prominent north @-@ facing <unk> , which can be attributed to its position amongst other mountains of similar height , causing it to receive relatively small quantities of precipitation 
Originally measured as 14 @,@ <unk> feet ( 4 @,@ <unk> m ) in height , Mount <unk> 's elevation was later adjusted to 14 @,@ 440 feet ( 4 @,@ 400 m ) following a re @-@ evaluation of mapped elevations , which sparked protests 
 The actual change was made in 1988 as a result of the North American <unk> <unk> of 1988 ; it seems the original measurement resulted from the Sea Level <unk> of 1929 
 A matter of some contention arose after the Great Depression over the heights of <unk> and its neighbor , Mount Massive , which differ in elevation by only 12 feet ( 3 @
@ 7 m ) 
 This led to an ongoing dispute that came to a head with the Mount Massive supporters building large piles of stones on the summit to boost its height , only to have the Mount <unk> proponents <unk> them 
 The effort was ultimately unsuccessful and Mount <unk> has remained the highest peak in Colorado 
 The first <unk> ascent of <unk> occurred in 1949 , when a Jeep was driven to the summit , apparently to judge suitability for skiing development 
The summit of Mount <unk> is an alpine environment , featuring plants such as <unk> <unk> ( sky @-@ pilot ) , <unk> <unk> ( old @-@ man @-@ of @-@ the @-@ mountain ) , and <unk> <unk> ( alpine <unk> ) 
 Also noted are <unk> <unk> var
 <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> album , <unk> <unk> var
 <unk> , and <unk> <unk> 
 Below <unk> the mountain is heavily forested , with the lower slopes covered with a mixture of lodgepole pine , spruce , <unk> and fir 
There are three main routes which ascend the mountain , all of which gain over 4 @,@ 100 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) of elevation 
 The standard route <unk> the peak from the east , starting from the Colorado Trail just north of Twin Lakes 
 The 4 @

@ 9 km ) long , climbing 4 @,@ 600 feet ( 1 @,@ 400 m ) at a less @-@ punishing gradient than the North <unk> Trail , approaching from the south and then climbing the eastern ridge 
The most difficult of the main routes is the Black Cloud Trail , a Class 2 climb that takes ten to fourteen hours depending on pace , gains 5 @,@ 300 feet ( 1 @,@ 600 m ) in elevation , and also involves an ascent of the sub @-@ peak , South <unk> , at 14 @,@ 134 feet ( 4 @,@ 308 m ) 
 Even healthy and experienced <unk> report great difficulty on this route , and despite the fact that there is a trail , the route is extremely steep , unstable , and rocky in places 
 The elevation gain is not evenly distributed over the 5 @
@ 5 @-@ mile ascent 
 There are also routes approaching from the western face , and southwestern ridge , from South <unk> Creek <unk> and Echo Canyon <unk> respectively 
Although strenuous and requiring physical fitness , none of the conventional routes require specialist <unk> skills or technical rock climbing 
 The main dangers of the mountain are those common to all high mountains , particularly altitude sickness 
 This can affect anyone , even those who are <unk> 
 In serious cases , it can lead to high @-@ altitude pulmonary <unk> and <unk> <unk> , which can lead to difficulties with breathing , <unk> , and death 
 <unk> are advised to begin their ascent at or before 6 a
m
 and to summit and descend before early afternoon to minimize exposure to possible afternoon thunderstorms while at high altitudes 
 Although the most conventional form of ascent is by hiking , Anna Elizabeth Dickinson , the <unk> , ascended the mountain on a mule borrowed from the U
S
 government 
German courts have so far not resolved whether Scientology should be accorded the legal status of a religious or <unk> community , and different courts have reached contradictory conclusions 
 The German domestic intelligence service has monitored the organization 's activities 
 The German government does not recognize Scientology as a religion 
 It views it as an abusive business <unk> as a religion and believes that it pursues political goals that conflict with the values enshrined in the German constitution 
 This stance has been criticized , most notably by the U
S
 government , which recognizes Scientology as a religion and has raised concerns about the violation of individual rights posed by sect <unk> 
On the subject of Scientology 's status as a religion , the German government has pointed to a 1995 decision by the Federal Labor Court of Germany 
 That court , noting Hubbard 's instruction that Scientologists should " make money , make more money – make other people produce so as to make more money " , came to the conclusion that " Scientology <unk> to be a ' church ' merely as a cover to pursue its economic interests " 
 In the same decision , the court also found that Scientology uses " <unk> and totalitarian practices " 
 Given the lessons of Germany 's 20th @-@ century history , in which the country came to be dominated by a fascist movement that started from similarly small beginnings , Germany is very wary of any ideological movement that might appear to be seeking a position of absolute power 
 <unk> in Scientology writings to the elimination of " parasites " and " <unk> " people who stand in the way of progress towards Scientology 's <unk> world " without <unk> , without criminals and without war " evoke uncomfortable parallels with Nazism , and have led to Scientology being classified as an " <unk> political movement " 
To further justify its stance , the German government has also pointed to the long history of U
S
 court cases involving Scientology , including the conviction of 11 top Scientologists in 1979 and 1980 for a conspiracy involving the infiltration of U
S
 government agencies , <unk> and the theft of government documents , a 1994 U
S
 Supreme Court finding that Scientology practices took place in a " <unk> environment " , and Scientology 's track record of pursuing its critics through malicious court cases and private investigators 
 In examining the potential threat posed by Scientology the German government has noted that Scientology organizations are " structured so as to make the individual <unk> and financially dependent on a Scientology system " , and that members often abandon contact with friends and family 
Scientology first became active in Germany in 1970 
 By 2007 , there were ten major centres ( " Scientology Churches " ) , as well as fourteen minor centres ( " Scientology <unk> " ) in Germany 
 The German Scientology Churches are located in the big cities – Munich , Hamburg , Berlin , Düsseldorf , Frankfurt am Main , Hanover and <unk> 
 Of the Scientology <unk> , nine are in Baden @-@ <unk> , and three in <unk> 
 Following German re @-@ unification , Scientology proved unable to gain significant numbers of followers in the territories of the former German Democratic Republic ; most adherents are found in Baden @-@ <unk> , <unk> and North @-@ Rhine <unk> 
Scientology is represented by a large number of independent associations or <unk> in Germany ; their umbrella organisation is the Scientology <unk> <unk> <unk> Germany 's domestic intelligence service , the <unk> für <unk> ( <unk> , or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution ) , estimates that there are 4 @,@ 000 Scientologists in Germany , down from earlier estimates of 5 @,@ 000 to 6 @,@ 000 
 The Church of Scientology reported around 30 @,@ 000 members from the mid @-@ 1990s onwards ; this number remained stable for many years 
 However more recently Scientology has said it has only 12 @,@ 000 members 
 <unk> in Scientology membership numbers arise because the Church of Scientology applies more inclusive criteria in establishing its figures , essentially including anyone who has purchased a book or participated in courses , regardless of their subsequent involvement 
 The number of <unk> bound Scientology staff members working in German Scientology organizations is unlikely to exceed a few hundred 
Scientology formulated a " <unk> Germany " strategy in 1994 – similar to equivalent strategies pursued by Scientology in other countries and regions of the world – with the long @-@ term aim of transforming German society in line with the <unk> ideal : a non @-@ <unk> society in which Scientology enjoys <unk> influence 
 The programme sought to address Scientology 's image problems in Germany , to identify weak points in Germany that could be exploited for political gain , such as Germany 's National Socialist history , and to increase both membership figures and political influence in German society , with a special emphasis on <unk> Scientologists into key positions in industry and government 
 As most religions seek to widen their influence in society , such a programme could of course also be defended as a missionary effort , much like those many religions engage in 
 However , according to the <unk> , the strategy has not had any significant success 
 By 1998 , 90 government officials had been suspected of being Scientologists and in 48 cases the suspicions were confirmed , but apart from some isolated cases , most of the officials concerned had not used their positions to advertise Scientology 
 According to <unk> & <unk> ( 2009 ) , it is unknown to what degree the " <unk> Germany " programme is still being pursued 
German public discourse does not regard Scientology as a religion , but generally <unk> it as a <unk> ( cult or sect ) , or as an <unk> profit @-@ making venture preying on vulnerable minds 
 Public concerns about the potential dangers posed by cults date back to the early 1970s , when widespread debate took place about " youth religions " such as the <unk> Church , <unk> , Children of God , and the Divine Light Mission 
 The most prominent critics of these new religious movements were the " sect commissioners " ( <unk> ) of Germany 's Protestant Churches , who also actively promoted the establishment of private " initiatives of parents and concerned persons " 
 <unk> <unk> ( " Educational Information Campaign " ) became an important organization dedicated to opposing Scientology ; taking an activist stance , it warned people not to get involved with Scientology , filed successful lawsuits against the Church of Scientology over its <unk> in public places , and published an influential book , The <unk> of Scientology and its Front <unk> 
 In 1981 , the organization 's founder , <unk> <unk> , became the director of <unk> für <unk> und <unk> <unk> ( " Campaign for <unk> and <unk> Freedom " ) , Germany 's most prominent anti @-@ cult organization 
 <unk> from sect experts about the influence of new religious movements gained media attention which put political pressure on the government to deal with the situation ; as the movements were not doing anything illegal , the government resorted to issuing a range of leaflets and public statements giving general warnings about religious <unk> , the earliest of these publications appearing in 1979 
As noted by the religious scholar Hubert <unk> , Scientology came to be seen as a " serious political danger that not only threatened to turn individuals into will @-@ less zombies , but was also conspiring to overthrow the democratic constitution of the state " 
 This view of Scientology as a public enemy , <unk> adds , " became a matter of political <unk> " : senior political figures became involved in launching campaigns against Scientology , and being suspected of any association with it resulted in social <unk> 
 Stephen A
 Kent , writing in 1998 , noted that officials at all levels of German government shared the insistence that Scientology should be suppressed 
 Scientology was viewed as " a totalitarian , business @-@ driven organization [ 


 ] guilty of significant human rights abuses 
 " Officials examining primary and secondary sources , legal documents , and the testimony of former members , concluded that the organization was " <unk> to a democratic state " 
 Federal <unk> and state governments were asked to use all legal means at their disposal to check the activities of Scientology 
German scholars such as <unk> <unk> and Gerald <unk> have commented that rhetoric dominates public discourse around Scientology in Germany : in their view , efforts to " frame " information in such a way as to shape opinion have long been more important than the underlying <unk> 
 In <unk> 's words , this includes both the " efforts of German politicians to enhance their popularity with strong @-@ <unk> statements " and " Scientology 's efforts to present itself as the victim of unjust persecution " ; commenting on foreign reporting on Scientology in Germany , she adds that " the American press may prefer <unk> news to boring investigation and may frame the issue according to American stereotypes " 
 Both <unk> and <unk> assert that the situation is compounded by the general <unk> of scientific studies of Scientology 
 <unk> as well as Irving <unk> , Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Calgary in Canada , have remarked in particular on the lack of academic studies by German scholars 
 <unk> attributes this situation to the strong influence of the Christian churches in Germany , which has made German academics wary of approaching the subject , because they fear repercussions for their research funding and for their prospects of future employment if they involve themselves in the debate 
The Federal Court of Justice of Germany has not yet made an explicit decision on the matter , but implicitly assumed in 1980 that Scientology represented a religious or <unk> community 
 The Upper Administrative Court in Hamburg explicitly asserted in 1994 that Scientology should be viewed as a <unk> community 
 In 1995 , the Federal Labor Court of Germany decided that the Church of Scientology merely pursued commercial aims and did not represent a religious or <unk> community entitled to protection under Article 4 of the German Constitution , although another decision by the same court left the question open again in 2003 
 In another 2003 decision , the Administrative Court of Baden @-@ <unk> in <unk> said there were no indications that the teachings of Scientology merely served as a pretext for commercial activity 
 In 2005 , the Federal Administrative Court of Germany explicitly granted a Scientologist protection under Article 4 @
@ 1 of the German Constitution , which declares the freedom of religion and <unk> <unk> 
At the federal level , Scientology lost a complaint against continued surveillance by the <unk> in November 2004 
 The federal court based its opinion on its judgment that the aims of Scientology , as outlined by L
 Ron Hubbard in his writings , were incompatible with the German constitution 
 <unk> acting for the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution pointed out that Hubbard had written that civil rights , for example , should be restricted to Scientologists , and they asserted that the Scientology organization was taking systematic steps to infiltrate society and government institutions in order to prevent anti @-@ Scientology legislation 
 <unk> counsel acting for the Church of Scientology had contended that Scientology was non @-@ political , its aims were the liberation of the human being , and that Hubbard 's instructions were valid only within the Church of Scientology and were subject to interpretation , and at any rate there was no effort to implement these instructions in Germany 
 The court disagreed and ruled that many sources , some of them not accessible to the general public , indicated that the aims of the Church of Scientology did include the <unk> of the principle of equality and other essential human rights 
Due to concerns about possible government infiltration by Scientologists , applicants for civil service positions in <unk> are required to declare whether or not they are Scientologists , and a similar policy has been instituted in <unk> 
 Companies <unk> for government contracts were likewise required to state they are not Scientologists ; in 2001 , this requirement was changed , and firms are now asked to sign a form stating that " the technology of L
 Ron Hubbard will not be used in executing the contract " 
 When it became known that Microsoft 's Windows 2000 operating system included a disk <unk> developed by Executive Software International ( a company headed by a Scientologist ) , this caused concern among German government officials and clergy over data security and the potential for espionage 
 To <unk> these concerns , Microsoft Germany agreed to provide a means to <unk> the utility 
 Following letters of complaint about discrimination from Scientology lawyers , some American companies such as General Electric , IBM and Ford Motor Company instructed their German <unk> to cease the use of protective declarations 
The city @-@ state of Hamburg set up a full @-@ time office dedicated to opposing Scientology , the Scientology Task Force for the Hamburg Interior Authority , under the leadership of <unk> <unk> 
 In 2005 , in a case brought by a Scientologist , the Federal Administrative Court of Germany ordered the city of Hamburg to cease recommending the use of protective declarations to its business community , finding that the practice <unk> religious freedom 
 In June 2008 , the Hamburg Administrative Court fined the city of Hamburg 5 @,@ 000 <unk> ( $ 7 @,@ 000 ) for not <unk> with court instructions banning the use of " sect <unk> 
 " Internet links to sample <unk> to be used by businesses had continued to remain available 
 <unk> Barker , a professor of sociology at the London School of Economics , has noted that " Germany has gone further than any other Western European country in <unk> the civil rights of Scientologists 
 " The Hamburg task force was closed down in August 2010 as a result of budget cuts ; <unk> moved to a position within the Hamburg interior authority , where she continues her work on Scientology 
Scientologists have been banned from joining major political parties in Germany such as the Christian Democratic Union , the Christian Social Union of <unk> , the Social Democratic Party of Germany and the Free Democratic Party 
 <unk> Scientologist members of these parties have been " purged " , according to Time Magazine 
 Scientologists have been prevented from running employment and au pair agencies in Germany ; Scientologists who were running such agencies had their permits revoked 
 In 1995 , a sports scientist and former member of the German national fencing team was dismissed from his job at the German Olympic fencing centre after he stated in an interview that he had enjoyed reading books by L
 Ron Hubbard and had participated in a course run by a Scientologist management and communication consultancy firm 
 Thomas <unk> , a German TV presenter , was falsely accused in 1993 of having taken part in Scientology courses ; <unk> responded by announcing that he had not , and that he would <unk> cease all contact with a friend who had links to Scientology 
 In 2007 , Günther <unk> , the Minister @-@ President of the German state of Baden @-@ <unk> , expressed concern that Scientologist John <unk> was to appear on <unk> 's programme , and asked the <unk> TV station to consider <unk> the invitation ; the <unk> said that <unk> <unk> would cause greater damage , and that Scientology was not going to be discussed in the programme 
In November 2008 , the government abandoned its attempts to ban Scientology , after finding insufficient evidence of illegal or unconstitutional activity 
 The report by the <unk> cited knowledge gaps and noted several points that would make the success of any legal undertaking to ban Scientology doubtful 
 First , the <unk> report stated there was no evidence that Scientology could be viewed as a foreign organization ; there were German churches and missions , a German board , German <unk> , and no evidence that the organization was " totally remote @-@ controlled " from the United States 
 A foreign organization would have been much easier to ban than a German one 
 The second argument on which those proposing the ban had counted was Scientology 's aggressive opposition to the constitution 
 Here , the report found that Scientology 's behaviour gave no grounds to assume that Scientology aggressively sought to attack and overthrow Germany 's free and democratic basic order 
 " Neither its <unk> nor any other utterances " supported the " conclusion that the organization had criminal aims " 
 The <unk> also considered whether there were grounds to act against the Church of Scientology on the basis that they were <unk> medicine without a licence , but expressed doubts that a court would accept this reasoning 
Commenting on the decision to drop the ban attempt , <unk> <unk> , Berlin 's interior minister , said , " This organization pursues goals – through its writings , its concept and its disrespect for minorities – that we cannot tolerate and that we consider in violation of the constitution 
 But they put very little of this into practice 
 The appraisal of the Government at the moment is that [ Scientology ] is a <unk> organization , but it is not an organization that we have to take a hammer to 
 " The Church of Scientology expressed satisfaction with the decision , describing it as the " only one possible " 
 <unk> of Scientology 's activities by the German intelligence services continues 
The U
S
 Department of State has repeatedly claimed that Germany 's actions constitute government and societal discrimination against minority religious groups and expressed its concerns over the violation of Scientologists ' individual rights posed by sect <unk> 
 The U
S
 Department of State began to include the issue of Scientology in Germany in its annual human rights reports after the 1993 agreement between the Church of Scientology and the U
S
 Internal Revenue Service , through which Scientology gained the status of a tax @-@ exempt religion in the United States 
 That decision also marked the beginning of more intense lobbying efforts by the Church of Scientology in Washington , using paid <unk> 
 The State Department 's 1996 human rights report on Germany , released in January 1997 , warned that artists and businesses with Scientology connections " may face boycotts and discrimination , sometimes with government approval 
 " Past targets of such actions had included Scientologist actors Tom Cruise and John <unk> , as well as jazz pianist Chick <unk> 
Also in January 1997 , an open letter to then @-@ Chancellor <unk> <unk> appeared , published as a newspaper advertisement in the International Herald Tribune , drawing parallels between the " organized oppression " of Scientologists in Germany and Nazi policies <unk> by Germany in the 1930s 
 The letter was conceived and paid for by Hollywood lawyer <unk> Fields , whose clients have included Tom Cruise and John <unk> , and was signed by 34 prominent figures in the U
S
 entertainment industry , including the top executives of MGM , Warner Bros
 , Paramount , Universal and Sony Pictures Entertainment as well as actors Dustin Hoffman and Goldie <unk> , director Oliver Stone , writers Mario <unk> and <unk> Vidal and talk @-@ show host Larry King 
 It echoed similar parallels drawn by the Church of Scientology itself , which until then had received <unk> notice , and was followed by lobbying efforts of Scientology celebrities in Washington 
U
S
 Department of State spokesman Nicholas Burns rejected the Nazi comparisons in the open letter as " <unk> " and distanced the U
S
 government from Nazi comparisons made by the Church of Scientology , saying , " We have criticized the Germans on this , but we aren 't going to support the Scientologists ' terror tactics against the German government 
 " Chancellor <unk> , commenting on the letter , said that those who signed it " don 't know a thing about Germany and don 't want to know 
 " German officials argued that " the whole fuss was <unk> up by the Scientologists to achieve what we won 't give them : tax @-@ exempt status as a religion 
 This is <unk> , pure and simple 
 " Officials explained that precisely because of Germany 's Nazi past , Germany took a determined stance against all " radical cults and <unk> , including right @-@ wing Nazi groups " , and not just against Scientology 
 <unk> 's Christian Democratic Union party denounced the letter as " absurd " and cited German court <unk> stating that Scientology had primarily economic goals and could legitimately be referred to using phrases such as a " <unk> <unk> of oppression " 
In February 1997 , a United States immigration court judge granted <unk> to a German Scientologist who claimed she would be subject to religious persecution in her homeland 
 In April 1997 , John <unk> met personally with U
S
 President Bill Clinton at a conference in Philadelphia 
 <unk> later said Clinton assured him that he would " really love to help " with the " issue over in Germany with Scientology " 
 According to <unk> , Clinton recalled that " he had a roommate years ago who was a Scientologist and had really liked him , and respected his views on it " , stating that Scientologists " were given an unfair hand in [ Germany ] and that he wanted to fix it " 
 In September 1997 , John <unk> , Chick <unk> and fellow Scientologist Isaac Hayes were heard by the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe ( <unk> , also known as the Helsinki Commission ) , voicing their complaints about the treatment of Scientologists in Germany , and had a briefing with United States National Security <unk> Sandy Berger , whom Clinton had assigned to be " the administration 's Scientology point person " 
 The German ambassador responded with a letter to the <unk> stating that the German government had come to the conclusion that Scientology 's " pseudo @-@ scientific courses can seriously jeopardize individuals ' mental and physical health and that it exploits its members " , adding that " membership can lead to psychological and physical dependency , to financial ruin , and even to suicide 
 In addition , there are indications that Scientology poses a threat to Germany 's basic political principles 
In 2000 , the German Stern magazine published the results of its investigation of the <unk> case 
 It asserted that several rejection letters which the woman had submitted as part of her <unk> application – ostensibly from potential employers who were rejecting her because she was a Scientologist – had in fact been written by fellow Scientologists at her request and that of Scientology 's Office of Special Affairs , and that she was in personal financial trouble and about to go on trial for tax <unk> at the time she applied for <unk> 
 On a 2000 visit to Clearwater , Florida , <unk> <unk> of the Scientology Task Force for the Hamburg Interior Authority likewise alleged that the <unk> case had been part of an " orchestrated effort " by Scientology undertaken " for political gain " , and " a spectacular abuse of the U
S
 system " 
 German expatriate Scientologists resident in Clearwater , in turn , accused <unk> of <unk> a " hate campaign " in Germany that had " ruined the lives and fortunes of scores of Scientologists " and maintained that Scientologists had not " exaggerated their plight for political gain in the United States 
 " Mark <unk> , a ( former ) top Church of Scientology official , said that although Scientology had not orchestrated the case , " there would have been nothing improper if it had 
The U
S
 Department of State 's 2012 report on religious freedom in Germany , published in 2013 , stated that " The status of the Church of Scientology remains in <unk> 
 The Constitutional Court and various courts at the state level have not explicitly ruled that Scientology is a religion 
 Government agencies at the federal and state level have rules and procedures that discriminate against Scientology as a group and against its members 
 Four of the major political parties ( the Christian Democratic Union , Christian Social Union , Social Democratic Party , and Free Democratic Party ) ban Scientologists from party membership 
 [ 


 ] Scientologists reported instances of governmental discrimination 
 Although courts at the state and federal level condemned the improper use of so @-@ called ' sect <unk> ' to <unk> and boycott Scientologists , they remained in use in the public sector 
 ' <unk> <unk> ' typically asked potential new employees to confirm in writing that they had no contact with Scientology , did not participate in its training courses , and rejected its doctrines

 Several private organizations issued warnings about after @-@ school study programs run by Scientologists 
Asahi ( <unk> , Asahi ) was a pre @-@ dreadnought battleship built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( <unk> ) in the late 1890s 
 As Japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships itself , the ship was designed and built in the United Kingdom 
 Shortly after her arrival in Japan , she became flagship of the Standing Fleet , the <unk> 's primary combat fleet 
 She participated in every major naval battle of the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 – 05 and was lightly damaged during the Battle of the Yellow Sea and the Battle of <unk> 
 Asahi saw no combat during World War I , although the ship participated in the Siberian Intervention in 1918 
<unk> as a coastal defence ship in 1921 , Asahi was disarmed two years later to meet the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty , after which she served as a training and submarine depot ship 
 She was modified into a submarine salvage and rescue ship before being placed in reserve in 1928 
 Asahi was recommissioned in late 1937 , after the start of the Second <unk> @-@ Japanese War , and used to transport Japanese troops 
 In 1938 , she was converted into a repair ship and based first at Japanese @-@ occupied Shanghai , China , and then Cam <unk> Bay , French Indochina , from late 1938 to 1941 
 The ship was transferred to occupied Singapore in early 1942 to repair a damaged light cruiser and ordered to return home in May 
 She was sunk en route by the American submarine USS Salmon , although most of her crew survived 
Combat experience in the First <unk> @-@ Japanese War of 1894 – 95 convinced the Imperial Japanese Navy of weaknesses in the <unk> École naval philosophy , which emphasized torpedo boats and commerce raiding to offset expensive heavily armoured ships 
 Therefore , Japan promulgated a ten @-@ year naval build @-@ up in early 1896 , to modernize and expand its fleet in preparation for further confrontations , with the construction of six battleships and six armoured cruisers at its core 
 These ships were paid for from the £ 30 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 indemnity paid by China after losing the First <unk> @-@ Japanese War 
 As with the earlier Fuji and <unk> classes , Japan lacked the technology and capability to construct its own battleships , and turned again to the United Kingdom for the four remaining battleships of the programme 
 Asahi , the fifth Japanese battleship to be built in Britain , was ordered from the <unk> Engineering & Shipbuilding Company shipyard in <unk> , Scotland in the 1897 annual naval programme 
Asahi 's design was a modified version of the <unk> @-@ class battleships of the Royal Navy , with two additional 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) guns 
 The ship had an overall length of 425 feet 3 inches ( 129 @

 She displaced 15 @,@ 200 long tons ( 15 @,@ 400 t ) at normal load 
 Asahi had a complete double bottom with 55 <unk> compartments 
 Her hull was also subdivided into 223 <unk> compartments 
 She was fitted as a flagship and her crew numbered about <unk> officers and enlisted men , including the admiral 's staff 
The ship was powered by two vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines built by <unk> , Tennant , each driving one propeller , using steam generated by 25 Belleville boilers at a working pressure of 17 @

 The engines were rated at 15 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 11 @,@ 000 kW ) , using forced draught , and designed to reach a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) although Asahi reached 18 @

Asahi 's main battery consisted of the same four <unk> Ordnance Company 40 @-@ calibre twelve @-@ inch guns used in all of Japan 's preceding battleships 
 They were mounted in twin @-@ gun turrets fore and aft of the superstructure 
 The <unk> powered mountings allowed the guns to be loaded at all angles of traverse , at a fixed elevation of + 13 @

 Each mount could traverse a total of 240 degrees 
 They fired 850 @-@ pound ( 386 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 400 ft / s ( 730 m / s ) 
The ship 's secondary armament consisted of fourteen 45 @-@ calibre 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) quick @-@ firing ( QF ) guns mounted in casemates 
 Eight of these guns were positioned on the main deck and the other six guns were placed above them in the superstructure 
 They fired 100 @-@ pound ( 45 kg ) shells at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 300 ft / s ( 700 m / s ) 
 Protection against torpedo @-@ boat attacks was provided by twenty QF 12 @-@ pounder 12 cwt guns

 The ship was also equipped with four submerged 18 @-@ inch torpedo tubes , two on each broadside 
The waterline main belt of Asahi consisted of Harvey armour 8 feet ( 2 @

 It was only 4 inches ( 102 mm ) thick at the ends of the ship and was surmounted by a six @-@ inch <unk> of armour that ran between the barbettes 
 The barbettes were 14 inches ( <unk> mm ) thick , but only 10 inches ( 254 mm ) behind the upper armour <unk> 
 The barbette <unk> were protected by 10 inches of armour on their face while their sides were 6 inches thick and the roof was 1 @

Asahi , meaning " rising sun " , a poetic name for Japan from a stanza of <unk> poetry , was laid down on 1 August 1898 in <unk> , Scotland , by the <unk> Engineering & Shipbuilding Co
 and completed by John Brown & Company , which purchased the firm before Asahi was completed 
 She was launched on 13 March 1899 and completed on 31 July 1900 
 Her completion was delayed by about three months when her bottom plating required repairs after running aground off <unk> following sea trials 
 The ship departed England , after repairs in Portsmouth , on the day of her completion , and arrived at <unk> , Japan , on 23 October 1900 
 Asahi became flagship of the Standing Fleet on 22 May 1901 and was assigned to the 1st Battleship Division of the 1st Fleet when the Combined Fleet was re @-@ formed on 28 December 1903 
At the start of the Russo @-@ Japanese War , Asahi , commanded by Captain <unk> <unk> , was assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Fleet 
 She participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on 9 February 1904 , when Vice Admiral <unk> <unk> led the 1st Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside Port Arthur 
 <unk> had expected the surprise night attack by his destroyers to be much more successful than it was , anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened , but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack 
 The Japanese ships were spotted by the protected cruiser <unk> , which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russian defences 
 <unk> chose to attack the Russian coastal defences with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns 
 <unk> his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese eight @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) and six @-@ inch guns inflicted little damage on the Russian ships , which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect 
 Although many ships on both sides were hit , Russian casualties numbered only 17 , while the Japanese suffered 60 killed and wounded before <unk> <unk> 
 Asahi was not hit during the engagement 
During the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August , Asahi , now commanded by Captain <unk> <unk> , was second in line of the column of Japanese battleships , behind <unk> , and was one of the primary targets of the Russian ships 
 She was only hit by a single 12 @-@ inch shell that wounded two crewmen 
 Both guns in her aft 12 @-@ inch gun turret , however , were disabled by shells that detonated prematurely in their barrels 
 In turn she concentrated most of her fire upon the battleships <unk> and <unk> although both ships were only lightly damaged by the Japanese shells , which generally failed to penetrate any armour and detonated on impact 
 The ship made the critical hits of the battle , however , when two of her 12 @-@ inch shells struck the bridge of <unk> , killing the Russian squadron commander , Vice Admiral <unk> <unk> , two of his staff officers and the ship 's <unk> 
 The ship 's wheel was jammed to port by wreckage and then slowed to a halt which threw the rest of the Russian ships into total confusion 
 The second @-@ in @-@ command , Rear Admiral Prince Pavel <unk> , eventually gained control of the remainder of the squadron and headed back to Port Arthur 
 <unk> more than two months later , on 26 October , Asahi struck a mine off Port Arthur while on blockade duty 
 <unk> damaged , she was under repair at <unk> Naval Arsenal from November 1904 to April 1905 
 Russian naval forces in the Far East had been destroyed or <unk> by this time and the Russians were forced to transfer ships from the Baltic Fleet that did not arrive until May 
At the Battle of <unk> on 27 May 1905 , Asahi again followed the battleship <unk> into combat , this time against the Second and Third Pacific Squadrons 
 <unk> opened fire at the battleship <unk> <unk> , the Russian flagship , at 14 : 10 , and was joined by Asahi and the armoured cruiser <unk> shortly afterwards 
 Within an hour the Japanese ships had started a serious fire aboard the Russian ship , badly wounded the fleet commander , Vice Admiral <unk> <unk> , knocked out her rear 12 @-@ inch gun turret , and jammed <unk> <unk> 's steering so that she fell out of formation 
 The Russian ships were concentrating their fire on <unk> during the early part of the battle and Asahi was not damaged during this time 
 <unk> was able to cross the T of the Russian squadrons 
 <unk> <unk> 's steering was later repaired , but she <unk> between the Japanese and Russian fleets several times later in the battle and was heavily damaged 
 Asahi seems to have mostly engaged the battleships <unk> and <unk> in the late stages of the battle , although Fuji fired the shots that caused the <unk> 's magazines to explode and sink her 
 Asahi fired more twelve @-@ inch shells , 142 , than any other ship during the battle 
 In total , the ship was hit six times during the battle , but none of them damaged her significantly 
 While Asahi 's casualties are not precisely known , the Japanese only lost 110 men killed and 590 wounded to all causes during the battle 
 The battle was a total Japanese victory with five Russian battleships captured and incorporated into the <unk> 
In 1908 , Asahi was part of the Japanese fleet that escorted the American Great White Fleet through Japanese waters during its round @-@ the @-@ globe voyage 
 The ship was assigned to the 1st Fleet in 1908 and 1910 – 11 
 Asahi became a gunnery training ship in 1914 , and was re @-@ armed in 1917 with Japanese guns replacing her original British @-@ made guns 
 The same year , she was assigned to the 5th Division of the 3rd Fleet 
 In 1918 , Asahi became flagship of her division and participated in the Japanese intervention in the Russian Civil War 
 She escorted troop convoys to the Russian Far East and was guard ship at <unk> from January to August 1918 
 Asahi was reclassified as a first @-@ class coastal defence ship on 1 September 1921 , and began <unk> in 1922 at <unk> in compliance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty 
 She was reclassified as a training and submarine depot ship on 1 April 1923 and her <unk> was completed in July of that same year 
 Her displacement dropped to 11 @,@ <unk> long tons ( 11 @,@ 625 t ) with the loss of her armour and guns , and her speed was limited to 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) 
The navy decided to convert Asahi into a submarine salvage ship and she began the first stage of her conversion with the installation of specialized salvage equipment from February to August 1925 
 From 1926 to October 1927 , the ship 's 25 Belleville boilers were replaced with four <unk> Type <unk> boilers at <unk> Naval Arsenal 
 One of her two funnels was also removed , and two large lifting frames were installed as part of the second stage of her conversion 
 The ship conducted experiments in submarine rescue using the old German submarine 0 @-@ 1 ( ex @-@ U @-@ 125 ) 
 In May 1928 , Asahi was fitted with a 62 @-@ foot @-@ 4 @-@ inch ( 19 m ) compressed @-@ air aircraft catapult on her forecastle and successfully launched an <unk> Type 15 seaplane 
 After repeated accidents , the catapult was replaced by one powered by gunpowder 
 On the completion of testing in 1928 , Asahi was placed in reserve 
<unk> as a repair ship on 16 August 1937 , Asahi was taken out of reserve in November , after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident that started the Second <unk> @-@ Japanese War , and was used as a transport to land troops in an amphibious landing at Hangzhou Bay 
 Afterwards she began conversion at <unk> , Japan , into a repair ship ; this was completed on 18 December 1938 
 Asahi was fitted with a <unk> wooden main battery fore and aft to resemble an old battleship after her arrival in Shanghai on 29 December 
 In May 1939 she was modified to act as a torpedo depot ship and carried out patrols between 29 May and 7 November 1940 
 She was transferred to <unk> Bay , French Indochina , on 15 November 1940 and later transported the 11th Base Unit from <unk> to <unk> Bay 19 November – 7 December 1941 
From 13 March 1942 , Asahi was stationed at Singapore , and in April her crew performed repairs on the light cruiser <unk> , which had been torpedoed by the submarine USS <unk> off Christmas Island 
 <unk> Singapore for <unk> on 22 May , escorted by the <unk> CH @-@ 9 , Asahi was sighted by the submarine USS Salmon on the night of 25 / 26 May 1942 , 100 miles ( 160 km ) southeast of Cape <unk> , Indochina 
 Of Salmon 's four torpedoes , two hit the ship in her port central boiler room and aft spaces 
 At 01 : 03 , moments after being hit , Asahi sank at 10 ° 00 ′ N 110 ° 00 ′ E
 Sixteen men were killed in the attack ; the ship 's captain and <unk> crewmen were rescued by CH @-@ 9

 The episode ultimately ranked as the highest @-@ rated NBC series of the night 
While <unk> gets annoyed with Jim and Pam , he loves the antics of Andy , who has resorted to physical comedy when his jokes fall flat , getting to the point where he <unk> hot coffee on his pants and ( at <unk> 's urging ) eats soap ; Andy tells the camera with <unk> sadness that " this is my life now " 
 <unk> 's popularity with the employees causes Michael to get jealous to the point where he passes out <unk> butter sandwiches , despite <unk> 's <unk> allergy 
 <unk> then <unk> the staff in the " multipurpose room " , including Dwight , who learned from <unk> that Michael did not put in a recommendation and thus <unk> Michael 
 Jim quietly tells Michael that he chose to resign his job and needs to come to terms with both that choice and the fact that life is going to go on at the office 
 <unk> then steps out of his meeting and asks Michael for advice for how to run the meeting , saying that he 's a good manager and Dunder Mifflin won 't be the same without him

 I want to fulfill my contract 
 When I first signed on I had a contract for seven seasons , and this coming year is my seventh 
 I just thought it was time for my character to go " 
 <unk> initially called the producers and offered to appear in Carell 's last season , because he 's " a fan and wanted to commemorate Carell ’ s swan song " 
 He had previously starred alongside Carell , in the 2004 film , <unk> : The Legend of Ron <unk>

 The A
V

 He ultimately gave the episode a " C + " 
 Alan Sepinwall , a columnist for HitFix , complimented the chemistry between <unk> and Carell , but criticized the storyline which eventually came down to Michael " being <unk> about not being the center of attention every minute of every day " , negatively comparing it to " <unk> Party "

Bonnie <unk> , for Paste , was more positive , writing that she preferred the use of comedy , following the emotional episode , " <unk> Sale " 
 She ultimately gave it an 8 @

 Will <unk> 's performance was especially noted by critics 
 <unk> complimented <unk> 's " <unk> " performance , but called his character " <unk> " 
 <unk> praised his dynamic with Carell , comparing it to their previous roles in <unk>

<unk> from a prominent political family , <unk> was chosen as Democrat William <unk> 's running mate in the gubernatorial election of 1899 despite the fact that he was not yet of legal age to serve as governor if called to do so 
 <unk> lost the election to Republican William S
 Taylor , but the Kentucky General Assembly disputed the election results 
 During the political wrangling that followed , an unknown assassin shot <unk> 
 A day later the General Assembly <unk> enough votes to give the election to <unk> , who was sworn into office on his deathbed 
 Taylor claimed the election had been stolen by the Democratic majority in the General Assembly and a legal fight ensued between him and <unk> over the governorship 
 <unk> ultimately prevailed and Taylor fled the state 
Following his term as governor , <unk> made a bid to become a U
S
 Senator 
 His stance in favor of prohibition cost him the votes of four legislators in his own party and the seat went to Republican William O
 Bradley 
 Six years later <unk> secured the seat by popular election , but he lost his re @-@ election bid largely because of his pro @-@ temperance views and his opposition to women 's suffrage 
 Though he continued to play an active role in state politics for another two decades , he never returned to elected office , failing in his gubernatorial bid in 1927 and his <unk> campaign in 1936 
 He died in Louisville on January 9 , 1940 
J
 C
 W
 <unk> was born at <unk> , near <unk> in Nelson County , Kentucky , son of William <unk> and Julia <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> 
 His maternal grandfather , Charles A
 <unk> , was governor of Kentucky from 1839 to 1840 and served as <unk> general in the administration of John Tyler 
 His uncle , Robert C
 <unk> , served as governor of Louisiana 
<unk> obtained his early education at <unk> Academy in <unk> 
 In 1881 he served as a page in the Kentucky House of Representatives at the age of 12 
 Later , he enrolled at Central University ( now Eastern Kentucky University ) in Richmond , Kentucky but was forced to quit school at the age of 17 to support his widowed mother 
 Two years later , he became principal of <unk> public schools , serving from 1888 to 1893 
 <unk> , he studied law at the University of Kentucky , where he earned his law degree in 1889 
 He was admitted to the bar , and commenced practice in <unk> in 1893 
 He also served as president of the Young Democrats ' Club of Nelson County 
<unk> lost a close election to Republican William S
 Taylor 
 When the General Assembly 's session opened on January 2 , 1900 , the election results were immediately challenged 
 With Democrats in control of both houses of the Assembly , the results seemed sure to be reversed 
 The Assembly was still <unk> on January 30 , 1900 , when <unk> was shot by an unknown assailant as he entered the state capitol building 
 The following day , as <unk> was being treated for his wounds at a local hotel , the General Assembly <unk> enough votes to give him the election 
 He was sworn into office from his bed the same day 
 Three days later <unk> died , never having risen from the bed 
Legislative chaos ensued as Taylor refused to acknowledge the Assembly 's decision and <unk> the governorship 
 The Republicans in the legislature <unk> Taylor 's orders , while the Democrats ignored Taylor and followed the orders of their leadership 
 Finally , on February 21 , 1900 , Taylor and <unk> agreed to let the courts settle the matter 
 The case first went before the Louisville Circuit Court , which found in favor of <unk> 
 Republicans appealed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals , at that time the court of last resort in the state 
 On April 6 , 1900 , the Court of Appeals upheld the ruling of the lower court 
 Taylor appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States , which declined to hear the case on May 21 , 1900 
 Taylor 's only supporter on the court was <unk> John Marshall <unk> 
Following the Supreme Court ruling , Taylor fled to Indianapolis , Indiana , fearing he would be implicated in <unk> 's assassination 
 <unk> became acting governor , but because of the unusual circumstances surrounding the election , a special election was held November 6 , 1900 , to determine who would complete <unk> 's <unk> term 
 <unk> ( now of age ) won the election over Republican John W
 <unk> by fewer than 4 @,@ 000 votes 
 Shortly following the special election , <unk> married Jean Raphael <unk> of <unk> 
 The couple had two sons 
As governor <unk> sought to unite his party and the state 
 As part of this effort he supported changes to the <unk> partisan <unk> Election Law , authored by his late running mate while the latter was a member of the General Assembly 
 He stressed non @-@ controversial issues such as improvements to roads and the state 's educational system 
 He recommended passage of a law to set uniform school textbook prices , a reform both he and <unk> had advocated during the gubernatorial campaign 
 However , his passive leadership ensured that the General Assembly did little to address his agenda 
 The only major pieces of legislation passed during <unk> 's term were a tax increase that added a half million dollars to the state 's revenue and a child labor law that forbade children under 14 to work without their parents ' consent 
Although the Kentucky Constitution prohibited governors from serving consecutive terms , <unk> announced he would seek a full term as governor in 1903 
 His candidacy was challenged in court , but the court ruled <unk> had not served a full first term and was eligible to run 
 Due to his record of reconciliation and supporting non @-@ controversial reforms , he had no significant opposition in winning his party 's nomination 
 His record also deprived his Republican opponent , Morris B
 <unk> , of any significant campaign issue in the general election 
 <unk> defeated <unk> and three minor candidates 
In March 1904 , <unk> signed the Day Law <unk> racial segregation of all schools in Kentucky 
 <unk> College , a private college in eastern Kentucky that had been integrated since the 1850s , immediately filed suit to challenge the law 
 The substance of the law was upheld in the circuit court and the Kentucky Court of Appeals 
 <unk> appealed to the Supreme Court , and in 1908 the court handed down an 8 – 1 decision against the college 
 Only John Marshall <unk> <unk> 
Near the close of the 1904 session , legislators approved the creation of <unk> County from parts of Carter , Elliott , and Lewis counties 
 Olive Hill was made the county seat 
 Soon the county 's existence was challenged in court on grounds that it fell short of the 400 square miles ( 1 @,@ 000 km2 ) required by the state constitution and that it reduced the counties it was carved from to less than 400 square miles ( 1 @,@ 000 km2 ) 
 Carter County joined the lawsuit , claiming the border of <unk> County passed too close to Grayson , the seat of Carter County , and <unk> , the seat of Lewis County 
 The state constitution forbade county borders to pass within 10 miles ( 16 km ) of a county seat 
 On April 29 , 1904 , the Kentucky Court of Appeals found in favor of the <unk> and dissolved <unk> County 
With a successful legislative session behind him , <unk> made a bold political move in June 1906 : he orchestrated an effort to set the Democratic gubernatorial and <unk> primaries in November – a full year before the gubernatorial election and two years before the <unk> election 
 <unk> wanted the Senate seat , and moving the primary up two years would allow him to secure his party 's nomination while he was still governor 
 It also allowed him to use his influence as governor to sway the party 's choice of his potential successor as governor 
 State <unk> Samuel Wilbur <unk> was <unk> 's choice for governor and easily won the early primary over <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 Former governor James B
 <unk> challenged <unk> for the <unk> nomination , but <unk> won by more than 11 @,@ 000 votes 
<unk> 's term as governor ended December 10 , 1907 
 In January 1908 he faced the legislature as the Democratic nominee for a seat in the U
S
 Senate by virtue of the primary held two years earlier 
 The Republicans nominated former governor William O
 Bradley 
 On the first ballot <unk> secured 66 of the needed 69 votes ; Bradley received 64 votes 
 Seven Democrats had not voted for <unk> 
 Over the next six weeks , 25 more votes were taken with neither man securing a majority , even though William Jennings Bryan , the Democratic nominee for president , campaigned for <unk> 
 Some Democrats pressured <unk> to withdraw and allow a more palatable Democrat to run , but he refused 
 On the 29th ballot , taken near the end of February 1908 , Bradley finally secured a majority after four Democrats crossed party lines to vote for him 
<unk> 's ardent support of prohibition likely cost him the election 
 His position put him at odds with Henry <unk> , editor of the powerful Louisville Courier @-@ Journal 
 As governor <unk> had crossed the liquor interests and the political machinery in Louisville 
 When the Kentucky Court of Appeals <unk> the results of Louisville 's municipal elections due to interference by the city 's " whiskey ring " in May 1907 , <unk> appointed Robert Worth <unk> , a young lawyer and fellow <unk> , as interim mayor until elections could be held in November 
 <unk> eliminated <unk> in the police department , closed gambling houses and enforced blue laws closing saloons on Sunday 
 Following this , the whiskey ring announced <unk> had forfeited the support of Louisville 's legislators 
 In the <unk> election in 1908 , three of the four Democrats who voted against <unk> were from Louisville 
 Following his defeat , <unk> returned to his law practice 
Six years later <unk> again attempted to win the Senate seat 
 Due to the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment , the senator would not be elected by the legislature , but by popular vote 
 In the Democratic primary <unk> defeated Augustus O
 Stanley , a 12 @-@ year veteran congressman 
 The Republican nominee was former governor Augustus E
 <unk> 
 <unk> by his support of President <unk> Wilson , <unk> won the election by 32 @,@ 000 votes 
True to his <unk> stance , <unk> supported passage of the <unk> Amendment <unk> the import and sale of alcohol in the United States 
 The amendment was ratified and became effective in January 1920 
 Believing women should be protected from involvement in politics , <unk> opposed the <unk> Amendment , which granted women 's suffrage 
 The amendment failed on February 10 , 1919 , but passed on June 4 , 1919 
 <unk> voted against it both times 
The Democrats <unk> <unk> without opposition in 1920 
 His opponent in the general election was Republican Richard P
 Ernst 
 Prohibition had destroyed the <unk> industry and the saloon business in the state , and in areas where these industries were prominent <unk> received more than 5 @,@ 000 fewer votes than Democratic presidential nominee James M
 Cox 
 He was also hurt by the women 's vote and by his support of President Wilson , who had lost popularity since <unk> 's election in 1914 
 Ernst won the election by fewer than 5 @,@ 000 votes , winning the race with 50 @
@ 3 percent of the vote to <unk> 's 49 @
@ 7 percent 
 During his single term in the Senate <unk> served alongside three other U
S
 Senators from Kentucky : <unk> M
 James , George B
 Martin and Augustus O
 Stanley 
Following his term in the Senate , <unk> resumed his legal practice in Louisville 
 He sought another term as governor in 1927 
 This time he had the support of the Louisville Courier @-@ Journal , which had been purchased by his ally , Robert W
 <unk> 
 He was opposed by a powerful political machine known as the <unk> Club , whose main interest was securing legislation to allow <unk> betting at the state 's horse <unk> 
The <unk> Club ran a candidate in both parties ' primary elections 
 In the Democratic primary <unk> defeated the Club 's relatively obscure candidate , Robert T
 Crowe 
 <unk> D
 Sampson , the Club 's nominee in the Republican primary , won his party 's nomination 
 In the general election <unk> could not secure the support of Democratic governor William J
 Fields , who had been elected with the help of the <unk> Club 
 Despite the Democrats winning every other contest on the ballot , including the race for lieutenant governor , <unk> lost to Sampson by more than 32 @,@ 000 votes 
 It was estimated that the Club spent over $ 500 @,@ 000 to defeat him 
<unk> was expected to be the Democrats ' nominee for governor in 1935 , but the death of his son in late 1934 left him distraught and his wife opposed to another campaign 
 The Democrats turned to A
 B
 " Happy " Chandler of Henderson , who won the election 
 <unk> supported Chandler 's bid , and in return Chandler appointed him to the Kentucky Public Service Commission in 1936 
 <unk> also served on the Department of Business Regulations Commission and chaired the State Government <unk> Commission 
<unk> attempted to return to the Senate in 1936 
 The head of the <unk> Club , James B
 Brown , had lost his fortune and influence when his banking empire crashed in 1930 
 In 1933 <unk> 's ally , Robert <unk> , had been appointed ambassador to the Court of St
 James 's , increasing his prominence and influence 
 <unk> also enjoyed the support of the United Mine Workers and Louisville mayor Neville Miller 
 The race was complicated , though , by the entry of John <unk> Brown , a Democrat who was a U
S
 Representative and former Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives 
 He had agreed to support Chandler 's bid for the governorship in exchange for Chandler 's support in his run for the Senate 
 However , Chandler threw his support to <unk> , and while Brown was not able to win the seat without the support of <unk> and Chandler , he did garner 85 @,@ 000 votes , most of them at <unk> 's expense 
 Democratic incumbent M
 M
 Logan retained the seat by 2 @,@ 385 votes 
The 1888 – 89 New Zealand Native football team was a New Zealand rugby union team that toured Britain , Ireland , Australia and New Zealand in 1888 and 1889 
 It mostly comprised players of Māori ancestry , and also included some <unk> ( white New Zealanders ) 
 A wholly private <unk> , the tour was not under the auspices of any official rugby authority ; it was organised by New Zealand international player Joseph <unk> , promoted by civil servant Thomas <unk> , and managed by James Scott , a <unk> 
 The <unk> were the first New Zealand team to perform a <unk> , and also the first to wear all black 
 They played 107 rugby matches during the tour , as well as a small number of Victorian Rules football and association football matches in Australia 
 Having made a significant impact on the development of New Zealand rugby , the <unk> were inducted into the International Rugby Board Hall of Fame in 2008 
After a preliminary tour of New Zealand in 1888 , the side travelled to England via Melbourne and Suez 
 The Māori players initially provoked curiosity due to their race , but the British press subsequently expressed some surprise that the side was not as " Māori " as they had expected 
 Playing their first match , on 3 October against Surrey , the team was subjected to a taxing match schedule , and frequently played three matches per week 
 Their early matches included a 9 – 0 loss to Middlesex , but their form improved in November , when they won 10 of their 13 matches 
 The team played its first international match on 1 December , against Ireland , and won 13 – 4 
 This was followed by a win over one of the strongest English county teams , Yorkshire , and a 5 – 0 defeat against the Wales national team 
 By January 1889 the <unk> had played 36 matches in less than three months , winning 22 of them ; they had spent most of their time in the north of England , where the playing strength was strongest and the crowds largest and most profitable 
In a return match on 19 January , Yorkshire fielded a stronger side than in the first match and inflicted one of the <unk> ' heaviest losses , a 16 – 4 defeat 
 The team then went undefeated until 16 February , when they faced England 
 Officials of the strictly amateur Rugby Football Union ( RFU ) had become increasingly concerned at the behaviour of the New Zealanders , regarding them as unsportsmanlike , and tensions reached a nadir in the aftermath of the England international , during which the RFU secretary George Rowland Hill , <unk> the game , awarded a number of controversial tries to England , prompting three of the <unk> to temporarily leave the field in protest ; England eventually won 7 – 0 
 The <unk> apologised afterwards for their behaviour , but the damage was not repaired 
 The New Zealanders left England without an official send @-@ off , and travelled to Australia where they toured Victoria , New South Wales and Queensland 
 They then returned to New Zealand , where they displayed a level of combination not seen in their home country before 
 They went 31 games undefeated before losing their final match , on 24 August 1889 , 7 – 2 to Auckland 
<unk> started assembling a team for the tour in early 1888 
 He had difficulties assembling a squad due to player availability , and failed to secure the talented Jack <unk> due to his university commitments 
 Some Māori players who initially agreed to play later pulled out when the eligibility criteria were relaxed to allow squad members who were only part @-@ Māori 
 Twenty Māori or part @-@ Māori players joined the squad ; five <unk> ( white New Zealand ) players were added after the team lost to Auckland 
 Due to the inclusion of these <unk> players the team was renamed from the " New Zealand <unk> " to the " New Zealand Native Football Representatives " 
 The final squad comprised 26 players ( including <unk> ) ; of these at least five were full @-@ <unk> Māori , while fourteen had a Māori mother and a <unk> father 
 The parentage of some of the players is unknown 
The team were met in Britain by local rugby administrators , including an official of England 's Rugby Football Union ( RFU ) 
 The first match of the tour was against Surrey , where the team became the first New Zealand side to perform a <unk> , and also the first to wear an all black uniform 
 That the team was predominantly Māori provoked curiosity from the British press – at the time , most Britons had not seen non @-@ white people – but there was some surprise that the team were not as " Māori " as had been expected 
 " They are not unlike Europeans , " a Scottish reporter wrote in November 1888 ; " that is their resemblance is great when one remembers that they were a savage tribe no further back than a generation " 
 The Surrey match , which was <unk> by the RFU secretary George Rowland Hill , was won 4 – 1 by the <unk> after they scored two tries 
The <unk> next defeated both <unk> and Kent , before defeats by <unk> and Burton @-@ on @-@ Trent 
 Both defeats were unexpected , and in the <unk> match , injuries played a part – the tourists played most of the match at least two men down , as replacements were then not allowed 
 The team recovered to win their next game , against Midlands Counties in Birmingham 
 Their next fixture was against Middlesex in a match not open to the public , and hosted by the Earl of Sheffield at Sheffield Park , <unk> 
 The Middlesex side contained a number of international players , including Arthur Gould 
 Middlesex won easily , with the <unk> play characterised by poor tackling 
 The final score was 9 – 0 , with three tries conceded by the New Zealanders 
 Prior to the match both sides had enjoyed lunch with wine – an indulgence the <unk> were not used to 
Following the match against Middlesex , the team travelled to the north , where the strongest English rugby teams were based 
 Yorkshire and Lancashire dominated the county championship until many of their respective member clubs split from the RFU in 1895 over the issue of " broken time " payments 
 The New Zealanders lost to Hull 1 – 0 , defeated <unk> , then lost to Wakefield 
 After their first draw of the tour ( against Northumberland County ) they defeated Stockton @-@ on @-@ <unk> and <unk> 
 Joe <unk> appeared in the match against <unk> , but aggravated the foot injury that had kept him out of the side until that point 
 These victories were followed by a 13 – 4 defeat to Halifax on 10 November 
 The team then won seven matches in a row , including one against <unk> RFC , their only Scottish opposition of the tour 
 The last two matches that month were a loss to <unk> and a 9 – 0 victory over Liverpool and District 
 The team had played thirteen fixtures during November and won ten of them 
 By this point , the team was beset by injuries – of the fifteen players that played against <unk> County on 24 November , five had injuries 
 The squad comprised only 26 players , and the tourists were often struggling to field a side 
 Nevertheless , their heavy schedule continued ; on 30 November 1888 they left for Dublin , where a match had been organised against the Ireland national team 
The Ireland fixture was played at Lansdowne Road , Dublin , on 1 December 1888 
 Both teams had a number of leading players out injured – the Irish were forced to make four changes to their original selection 
 Ireland led 3 – 0 at half @-@ time after scoring a converted try , but the <unk> improved considerably in the second @-@ half , scoring four tries 
 Patrick <unk> scored the first two tries , and his play was praised by the local press 
 The third try scored was by Thomas <unk> after a counter @-@ attack by George Williams 
 The try was not converted , but the strong finish from the New Zealanders gave the visitors a 13 – 4 victory 
 The Irish press were surprised by the loss and strongly criticised their team , but Ireland did go on to defeat Wales two tries to nil in the 1889 Home Nations Championship 
 Following their defeat of Ireland , the <unk> played Trinity College and then North of Ireland 
 The match against Trinity College was drawn 4 – 4 , and despite <unk> not playing , the Native side played much better than their previous fixture 
 The team then travelled to Belfast , where they defeated North of Ireland 2 – 0 on 5 December ; scoring two tries to nil 
After returning to England , the <unk> faced Lancashire in Manchester , where they lost 1 – 0 
 Two days later they drew with <unk> Bulldogs , despite their opposition scoring five tries 
 Their next match was against Yorkshire , who were one of the strongest counties in the country , and went on to win the inaugural County Championship that season 
 Yorkshire fielded a weakened team , and were subsequently defeated 10 – 6 by the <unk> , who scored six tries 
 After a further two victories , the team travelled to Wales , where they lost 3 – 0 to <unk> , before facing Wales on 22 December 
At the start of the match the home crowd were fairly hostile towards the Welsh team due to fans of both Swansea and <unk> feeling slighted by the lack of selection of their players 
 Four teams dominated Welsh international selection at the time , and out of the 15 @-@ man team only William Towers and William Bowen of Swansea and Dan <unk> of <unk> had been selected 
 The match was played in Swansea , and the lack of local players may have contributed to a poor crowd , with gate receipts of only £ 120 recorded 
 The crowd 's hostility impacted on the players , and <unk> Norman <unk> was " <unk> nervous " at the start of the match 
 <unk> , aged 18 years and 49 days , became the youngest Welsh international player – a record he held until the debut of Tom <unk> in 2010 
 Despite the <unk> aimed primarily at <unk> , Charlie Arthur and George Thomas , the Welsh team produced an excellent effort , especially from the forwards 
Towers scored the first Welsh try , which was converted by Jim Webb 
 The <unk> replied with a spirited run by <unk> , but he failed to break through the Welsh defence 
 The tourists trailed even further after George Thomas scored a <unk> try <unk> the half @-@ way line , which went some way to silence the <unk> from the crowd 
 Webb , playing in out of position at full @-@ back , missed the conversion and then failed at a long distance goal from a mark 
 The <unk> continued to push , with Elliot coming within five @-@ yards of the try line , and when <unk> did manage to cross the line he was carried back into the 25 @-@ yard line before he could touch down 
 In the second half Wales continued to push their advantage when Alexander <unk> <unk> the ball into the <unk> ' 25 ; this was collected by Sydney Nicholls , who managed to get the ball across the try line , allowing Jim <unk> to score 
 <unk> for the <unk> and <unk> for Wales both subsequently came close to scoring tries , but there were no further scores in the game 
The match was also of historical importance because of the Welsh tactics employed 
 In the 1886 Home Nations Championship Wales had <unk> the four three @-@ quarter system , wherein the team would play with eight forwards rather than nine , and instead employ an extra centre three @-@ quarter 
 The system was deemed a failure and was particularly unpopular with star Welsh player Arthur Gould , whose formidable ability as a back allowed his club team Newport to retain the additional forward 
 With Gould working in the West Indies , Wales again tried the four three @-@ quarter system against the <unk> , and its success saw the team permanently adopt the system 
 Within six years the other three Home Countries had adopted four three @-@ quarter style of play 
The side entered 1889 having played 36 matches for 22 wins and three draws 
 The <unk> ' play had improved throughout November and December following poorer form in their October matches ; positive press reports reflected this improvement 
 The team would go on to play a further 17 matches before their 16 February international against England 
 January started with a 4 – 1 loss to Bradford , during which 25 police officers were required to keep many of the 12 @,@ 000 spectators , many of them non @-@ paying , in order 
 This was followed by victories over Leeds Parish Church , <unk> , <unk> Rangers , and Huddersfield 
 Following further matches against <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , where the team drew , lost , then won , the side faced Yorkshire for a second time 
Yorkshire had been criticised in the press for fielding a weakened line @-@ up against the <unk> when the sides first met in December 
 After the unexpected loss , Yorkshire were determined to make <unk> and a strong side was selected for the county , including Fred <unk> , Richard <unk> and John Willie <unk> , all of whom would appear for England against the <unk> later that season 
 Described as " knocked about " and " stale " , the <unk> struggled to compete against such strong opposition , and Yorkshire scored three converted tries before a try to <unk> left the scores at 9 – 1 at half @-@ time 
 The second @-@ half was little better for the <unk> ; they conceded a further two tries as well as a drop @-@ goal 
 The second of these tries was scored by <unk> after he ran the ball from his own half 
 <unk> scored a converted try late in the match , but this didn 't prevent the <unk> suffering their largest defeat of the tour : 16 – 4 to the <unk> 
 <unk> later described the match as " without a <unk> , the biggest beating we received in our whole tour " 
After a victory over <unk> Valley District , the team travelled west to play <unk> , Devonshire , Taunton , and Gloucestershire , and won all five games 
 The victory over Somerset was the New Zealanders ' largest of the tour ; they scored nine tries in a 17 – 4 victory 
 Half @-@ back <unk> played outstandingly for the <unk> , while the entire side demonstrated superior passing and combination to their opposition 
 Devonshire and <unk> suffered heavy defeats by the New Zealanders , before a strong Gloucestershire side was dismissed 
 After defeating Midland Counties , the <unk> returned to London 
The team had two further matches before their international against England 
 The first was against one of the strongest clubs in England , <unk> 
 Andrew <unk> , who had toured New Zealand and Australia with the 1888 British Isles side , played for the club in their 9 – 3 defeat to the <unk> 
 The New Zealanders won having scored four tries , including two by <unk> 
 Their next opposition was a United Services side mainly comprising Royal Navy players 
 The <unk> were again victorious , this time 10 – 0 
 The match against Oxford University was postponed due to heavy <unk> , and so the team had a seven @-@ day break from playing – their longest of the tour 
The match against England was causing the <unk> ' players and management problems before it had even begun 
 The team manager , Scott , was in dispute with the RFU over where the match should be played – the RFU were adamant that the match should take place at <unk> 's ground , but Scott wanted the game to proceed at The Oval , where a larger crowd , and therefore higher gate receipts , could be secured 
 The strictly amateur RFU establishment were already suspicious of the profit @-@ making motives of the <unk> , and were unwilling to yield on the selection of venue 
 The RFU was also in dispute with the other Home <unk> over the formation of the International Rugby Football Board ( <unk> ) 
 Following a disputed try in an England – Scotland international match in 1888 , the Scottish authorities had pushed for the establishment of an international body to oversee the game , but the RFU insisted that they would only join if they held a deciding vote , arguing that they deserved this as they were , they asserted , the senior body , and had the most member clubs 
 Ireland , Wales and Scotland consequently refused to play against England until 1891 , when , following arbitration , the RFU relented and joined the <unk> 
 The absence of international matches was a factor in England agreeing to face the <unk> on 16 February 1889 
The line @-@ ups selected for the 16 February match were both strong , and close to full strength 
 Though 12 of the England side had not played internationally before , all were experienced at domestic level 
 The match was <unk> by Rowland Hill , who had also <unk> the <unk> ' first match in Britain , against Surrey 
 The opening of the first half was a scoreless affair , with much tackling and <unk> on the heavy ground 
 Later in the half England scored two tries through Harry Bedford , but both were disputed by the <unk> , who claimed that one of their players had grounded the ball in @-@ goal 
 England took the two @-@ try advantage into the second half 
Early in the second half a third disputed try was scored by the English 
 The try and its aftermath caused controversy and a rift between the <unk> and the RFU 
 <unk> attempted to tackle the English player <unk> , and in the process ripped his shorts off 
 The <unk> quickly formed a circle around <unk> to allow him to replace his clothing without being seen 
 While this was happening one of the English players , Frank <unk> , picked up the ball and scored a try 
 The New Zealanders protested , believing that play had stopped after claiming <unk> had called " dead ball " – but Hill awarded the try , prompting three of the Native players , Dick <unk> , Williams , and <unk> <unk> , to leave the field in protest 
 The <unk> players were eventually persuaded to return , but not before Hill had <unk> play 
 <unk> was very critical of Hill , particularly because he was also Secretary of the RFU 
 <unk> wrote after the tour that " gross as these errors were , they were insignificant when compared with another that Mr Hill committed at the outset of the game , <unk> , <unk> at all in that game " 
 The disputed try was followed by a final try for the English , who ultimately won 7 – 0 
The <unk> remained in London following the England international 
 They defeated London Welsh on 18 February , before losing first to Cambridge , then Oxford University 
 From there they travelled north and won two matches before losing to Leigh 
 After a win over <unk> , there was a defeat to Oldham , played on a ground <unk> said was so frozen it was dangerous 
 After reversing their previous loss to Halifax with a 6 – 0 win , the <unk> suffered a loss to Barrow and District on 7 March 
 The New Zealanders then had a run of seven straight wins before a 1 – 1 draw with Hull 
 <unk> were then defeated for the second time in two weeks in the tourists ' last match in northern England 
The team struggled to find an opponent for their final match in Britain 
 They eventually played Southern Counties , and beat them 3 – 1 
 This was their <unk> match in the British Isles and their 49th victory 
 The authorities and press in London continued to view the team negatively , and the <unk> boarded ship without a formal farewell 
 This perceived <unk> from the RFU provoked some criticism from the press outside London , as well as from the team manager Scott , who felt that with the team 's official apology after the England match , the controversy should have put to rest 
The majority of the <unk> left Plymouth on 29 March ( <unk> and Pie <unk> followed a week later ) 
 They arrived in Melbourne in May , where the team played mostly Victorian Rules football , hoping to make more money that way 
 Although the side had employed Jack <unk> to coach them in Victorian Rules during their tour of the British Isles , the heavy schedule and high injury count had left little time and energy for such training 
 As a result , the Victorian Rules matches were a failure ; the players ' <unk> with the rules , combined with the fact that most of the <unk> were rugby forwards ( and therefore less suited to the more open Victorian Rules ) , ensured that they failed to perform well on the field and struggled to attract large crowds 
 The side played nine Victorian Rules matches in total , including one in New South Wales , but won only three of them , all against relatively weak opposition 
The side 's success in their rugby matches contrasted to their failure in Victorian Rules – the New Zealanders played three rugby matches while in Victoria : against Melbourne , a Navy selection , and Victoria 
 The matches were all won , with their game against Victoria a 19 – 0 victory 
 After this they left for Sydney for further rugby matches , and defeated New South Wales 12 – 9 
 After two further victories , the side again faced New South Wales , and won the match 16 – 12 
 Another two victories followed , before the team played their only association football matches of the tour – both defeats 
The team travelled north to Queensland , where , as in New South Wales , rugby was the dominant code of football 
 Consequently , the team exclusively played rugby while in the region 
 The <unk> faced Queensland at the Association Ground in Brisbane 
 The 8000 spectators witnessed the New Zealanders overwhelm the <unk> to win 22 – 0 ; the <unk> did not exert themselves in the win , and the score did not reflect their dominance 
 After a further two matches , against <unk> and Ipswich ( both of whom were comfortably defeated ) , the team returned to Brisbane for a rematch with Queensland 
 In contrast to their first meeting , the first @-@ half was a close affair , and the two sides were tied at the conclusion of the half 
 Billy <unk> suffered a kick to the head , and had to retire early in the second @-@ half 
 Following the loss of <unk> , the play of the <unk> improved and they recovered to win 11 – 7 
 Not long after the game concluded rumours circulated that some of the players had been offered ₤ 50 by <unk> to throw the game 
Two days after their return , the <unk> faced <unk> , who they defeated 5 – 1 in front of a crowd of 2 @,@ 000 
 The side suffered further injury , to Harry Lee , and recruited <unk> W
 <unk> for their match against <unk> District on 8 August 
 Despite playing the match two players down , the <unk> comfortably defeated <unk> 16 – 3 
 Following the side 's return to New Zealand , the <unk> Rugby Football Union demanded that the team 's management explain the accusations levelled at them in Queensland 
 <unk> responded by insisting that the players had only been suspended while an investigation was conducted , and that the management was confident no wrongdoing had occurred 



 it was apparent to a judge of the game that something was wrong with the <unk> , as they were not showing their usual dash and combination 
 Four members of the team were suspended , a charge being made against them of attempting the sell the match 
 The matter was bought before the <unk> Union , who passed the following resolution : That , having heard all available evidence regarding the charges against certain members of the Native Team , and having received an explicit denial of charges from the accused members and a satisfactory explanation from the management , we are of opinion that there are no facts before us <unk> the allegations 


It is unlikely , given the attitude of the <unk> Rugby Union to the <unk> before their departure , that they would have dismissed the allegations if <unk> evidence had existed 
 The side was back to full strength following the return of their suspended players when the side faced <unk> in <unk> 
 The <unk> <unk> their opponents five tries to two , and won 11 – 8 
 The side 's star player and half @-@ back , <unk> , stayed in <unk> when the team departed for <unk> 
 The side faced <unk> 's Bay , who were touring , in <unk> , and <unk> defeated them 13 – 2 
 The <unk> ' play was praised by The Press : " 


 the <unk> of the black passed with remarkable accuracy and <unk> between their legs , over their shoulders , under their arms and with their feet " 
 The side then faced Canterbury on 17 August , who they <unk> 15 – 0 
The play showed on Saturday afternoon was a fine exhibition of what several months of combination and practice will do 


 it must be admitted they were far and away too good for our local men 
 In the loose , in the <unk> , <unk> , passing , <unk> , or running they were very much indeed Canterbury 's superior 
 Such runs as were made by <unk> at full back , by Madigan , <unk> , and W
 <unk> , the passing of H
 <unk> , F
 <unk> , and all the backs as well as several forwards , the rushes of <unk> <unk> , Maynard , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and the <unk> and <unk> powers of nearly every one , <unk> their opponents 


The side left <unk> and travelled north where they played <unk> in Masterton 
 The match was won 10 – 8 , and the next day they faced Wellington , who they also defeated 
 The fixture against Wellington was nearly abandoned because Scott and the Wellington Rugby Union could not agree on a venue ; the match went ahead only when the Wellington officials agreed to cede the <unk> all profit from the match 
 After this the <unk> travelled to Auckland where they played their last match , against the province on 24 August 
 The match was lost 7 – 2 after each team scored two tries each , but the <unk> kicked a drop @-@ goal and a conversion 
 The loss ended a remarkable run of matches – the <unk> had a 31 @-@ game unbeaten streak in rugby matches that started with their victory over <unk> on 9 March ; the side won 30 , and drew one match between the defeats 
The niece of Lady <unk> and Sir Wilfrid <unk> , who also were her patrons , she initially trained and performed in Europe 
 She then travelled to Java and for four years immersed herself in its native music , which she introduced to North American audiences on her return 
 She retired from performing in 1937 , and opened a voice studio in New York , where she became a founding member of the American Guild of Musical Artists and served on its board of governors 
 <unk> was praised for the many qualities her singing brought to music 
 The citation from the <unk> Society of San Francisco , which she received in 1949 , said : " 


<unk> travelled to France , where she received private voice lessons from Auguste @-@ Jean <unk> of the Paris <unk> 
 <unk> on her vocal <unk> were problematic , but they were removed <unk> 
 She later began training under Jacques <unk> , whom she would later credit for her vocal technique 
 In 1906 , <unk> was retained by fellow Canadian singer Emma Albani to accompany her on a tour of England and her Canadian farewell tour 
 Albani provided a degree of <unk> to <unk> during the 30 week tour of Canada 
Lord <unk> awarded <unk> a scholarship in 1906 that allowed her to return to Europe and continue her vocal studies 
 She returned there and continued both to study and give performances 
 Her first operatic performance came in 1909 in <unk> , Italy as <unk> in <unk> 's Carmen 
 She landed a second operatic role as <unk> in <unk> ' <unk> , which was being performed by the London Covent Garden opera company 
 The opera opened in June 1910 
 <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> soprano of the company , feared that <unk> 's voice would <unk> her own , and demanded that <unk> be removed from the opera 
 The company 's director <unk> to <unk> 's demands , informing <unk> on opening night that she would not be performing 
 <unk> reacted badly , and quit opera entirely 
<unk> by her blocked entry into the operatic scene , <unk> departed Europe and travelled to Java 
 There , she met a Dutch <unk> and plantation manager named <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> and <unk> married on May 22 , 1911 
 <unk> studied the music of Java , and began to include this in her repertoire 
 Her accompanying pianist was Paul <unk> , who had previously been the conductor for the <unk> of <unk> , which afforded <unk> a number of opportunities 
 On permission of the Javanese court , she studied the <unk> , probably being the first western woman with a classical music education to be afforded this opportunity 
 While living in Java , <unk> travelled extensively , giving performances in China , Japan , Singapore , Malaya , Australia , and New Zealand 
 She remained in Java for four years , but with the outbreak of World War I she decided to travel back to North America , arriving in New York City in the fall of 1915 
Arriving in New York , <unk> struggled to find a niche in an already crowded music scene 
 She put on a performance in Vaudeville entitled <unk> , which combined <unk> music with dancers 
 New York was already home to many North American and European musical performers , so <unk> focused on her <unk> musical repertoire , which she combined with knowledge and skill in modernist western singing 
 <unk> began giving annual recitals at <unk> Hall , and in November 1917 her performance there caught the eye of many leading composers 
 She developed her own reputation quickly , known as a " 


 sensitive <unk> of interesting , <unk> songs " 
 She gave renditions of three songs by Maurice Ravel 
 Her performance then also included American premieres of Stravinsky 's Three Japanese Lyrics and <unk> ' Five Poems of Ancient China and Japan 
 The performance was a great success , and she began to receive invitations to perform premieres of songs by contemporary composers 
 Stravinsky arranged to have <unk> to premiere all of his vocal pieces 
<unk> travelled to Paris in 1920 at the behest of the Music League of America 
 <unk> there to arrange a tour of North America by Maurice Ravel , she struck up a friendship and professional correspondence not only with him , but also with Erik <unk> and Les six 
 This led to more music being sent to her by various composers that she would premiere in concert 
 She accepted and premiered almost all works sent to her , the only exception being a refusal to perform <unk> <unk> by Arnold <unk> 
 Through this , <unk> performed large amounts of contemporary French music across the United States 
 She also included American music in all of her concerts 
 <unk> toured America frequently and returned to Europe in 1922 , and again in 1923 
 She began to explore Jazz music in concert as well , earning her negative reviews by many musical critics 
Her 1923 annual performance at <unk> Hall entitled " <unk> of Ancient and Modern Music for Voice " became a historic occasion when she presented the works of George <unk> , the first time his works were performed by a classical singer in concert 
 The first half of the programme presented works considered serious music at the time 
 She performed both classical works by <unk> <unk> and Henry Purcell , mixing them with modernist and neoclassical works by Arnold <unk> , Darius <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and Paul <unk> 
 The second half of her performance would upset the musical establishment , however 
 She opened with Alexander 's <unk> Band by Irving Berlin , then performed works by Jerome Kern and Walter Donaldson , and finally finished with three works by George <unk> : I 'll <unk> a <unk> to Paradise , Innocent <unk> Baby , and <unk> 
 <unk> played the piano for these pieces 
 Important figures in the audience included <unk> Schumann @-@ <unk> , Virgil Thomson , and Paul <unk> 
 Although some musical critics panned her decision to include Jazz music , the performance was overall a huge success , and provoked serious discussion among conservative audiences whether jazz music could be considered serious art 
<unk> continued to present music that was thought poorly of by conservative audiences 
 On some occasions , such as her performances of <unk> in New York in 1923 and 1925 , as well as in London in 1925 , this was quite successful 
 A critic in Vienna welcomed her musical selection as a <unk> from the usual fare of classical performances - Schubert , <unk> , Wolf , Richard <unk> - while praising her skill with more classical choices 
 Other performances suffered – she was <unk> while performing works by <unk> Villa @-@ <unk> at the Festival of the International Society of Contemporary Music in Venice 
 She became a celebrity , and continued giving performances across the United States , Europe , and her native Canada 
 On the <unk> anniversary of Canadian Confederation in 1927 , she gave a performance in Ottawa which was the first <unk> radio broadcast in Canada 
 Although she toured Canada from time to time , and attended performances of Canadian music in New York , she held a negative opinion of Canada 's treatment of native musicians , saying " Canadians 
 
 
 would rather listen to foreigners than their own people 
Illness forced <unk> to halt giving performances in the late 1920s , but she would return to the stage in 1931 , giving a concert in Havana , Cuba 
 As time passed she began to engage more and more in teaching , and less and less in stage performing 
 Her income from teaching was substantially better than from touring 
 She retired from performing entirely in 1937 , and opened a music studio in New York 
 There she became a founding member of the American Guild of Musical Artists , serving on its board of governors 
 She died on December 20 , 1958 
A May 1 , 1917 review by the New York Times praised her natural talent , with some reservations about the <unk> quality of her voice 
 Her ability to capture the spirit of the pieces was also praised : " 


 her singing of songs by Frenchmen of today and the day before yesterday gave pleasure because of her understanding of them and the appropriate expression which she found for them 
A November 12 , 1923 Time review of her performance of historic Italian songs , as well as modern English , French , Austrian , German and American numbers focused on her choice to include selections of contemporary jazz music 
 The critic remarked " Her voice was much too good for jazz 
 " Here she was praised as a serious , scholarly artist whose performance was " 


 <unk> and expressive 
 " The audience received the concert very enthusiastically 
The British organized an expedition in early 1776 for operations in the rebellious southern colonies of North America 
 <unk> by logistical concerns and bad weather , the expedition reached the coast of North Carolina in May 1776 
 Finding conditions unsuitable for their operations , General Henry Clinton and Admiral Sir Peter Parker decided instead to act against Charleston 
 Arriving there in early June , troops were landed on Long Island , near Sullivan 's Island where Colonel William <unk> commanded a partially constructed fort , in preparation for a naval bombardment and land assault 
 General Charles Lee , commanding the southern Continental theater of the war , would provide supervision 
The plan was beset by difficulties from the start 
 The Irish expedition , originally supposed to depart at the beginning of December 1775 , was delayed by logistical difficulties , and its 2 @,@ 500 troops did not depart until February 13 , 1776 , escorted by 11 warships under the command of Admiral Sir Peter Parker 
 Clinton left Boston on January 20 with two companies of light infantry , and first stopped at New York City to confer with William Tryon , New York 's royal governor 
 Major General Charles Lee , sent by Major General George Washington to see to the defense of New York , <unk> arrived there the same day as Clinton 
 New York was at that time extremely tense ; <unk> forces were beginning to <unk> and evict <unk> , and the British fleet anchored there was having difficulty acquiring provisions 
 Despite this , Clinton made no secret that his final target was in the south 
 Lee observed that this was " certainly a <unk> way of proceeding ; to communicate his full plan to the enemy is too novel to be credited 
 " This was not even the first notice of the expedition to the colonists ; a letter intercepted in December had already provided intelligence that the British were planning to go to the South 
<unk> saw Sullivan 's Island , a sandy <unk> of land at the entrance to Charleston Harbor extending north about 4 miles ( 6 @
@ 4 km ) long and a few hundred yards wide , as a place well suited to build a fort that could protect the entrance from <unk> enemy warships 
 A large vessel sailing into Charleston first had to cross Charleston Bar , a series of submerged <unk> lying about 8 miles ( 13 km ) southeast of the city , and then pass by the southern end of Sullivan 's Island as it entered the channel to the inner harbor 
 Later it would also have to pass the northern end of James Island , where Fort Johnson commanded the southeastern approach to the city 
 <unk> and his 2nd South Carolina Regiment arrived on Sullivan 's Island in March 1776 , and began construction of a fortress to defend the island and the channel into Charleston Harbor 
 The construction moved slowly ; Captain Peter <unk> of the <unk> naval detachment described the site as " an immense pen 500 feet long , and 16 feet wide , filled with sand to stop the shot " 
 The gun platforms were made of <unk> two inches thick and <unk> with wooden spikes 
Congress had appointed General Lee to command the Continental Army troops in the southern colonies , and his movements by land shadowed those of Clinton 's fleet as it sailed south 
 Lee wrote from Wilmington on June 1 that the fleet had sailed , but that he did not know whether it was sailing for Virginia or South Carolina 
 He headed for Charleston , saying " [ I ] confess I know not whether I shall go to or from the enemy 
 " He arrived in Charleston shortly after the fleet anchored outside the harbor , and took command of the city 's defenses 
 He immediately ran into a problem : the South Carolina troops ( militia or the colonial regiments ) were not on the Continental line , and thus not formally under his authority 
 Some South Carolina troops resisted his instructions , and <unk> had to intervene by proclaiming Lee in command of all South Carolina forces 
Square @-@ shaped Fort Sullivan consisted only of the completed seaward wall , with walls made from <unk> logs 20 feet ( 6 @
@ 1 m ) high and 16 feet ( 4 @
@ 9 m ) wide 
 The walls were filled with sand , and rose 10 feet ( 3 @
@ 0 m ) above the wooden platforms on which the artillery were mounted 
 A hastily erected palisade of thick <unk> helped guard the powder magazine and unfinished northern walls 
 An assortment of 31 cannon , ranging from <unk> and 12 @-@ pounders to a few British 18 @-@ pounders and French 26 @-@ pounders , dotted the front and rear walls 
 General Lee , when he had seen its unfinished state , had recommended abandoning the fort , calling it a " slaughter pen " 
 President <unk> refused , and specifically ordered Colonel <unk> to " obey [ Lee ] in everything , except in leaving Fort Sullivan " 
 <unk> 's delaying tactics so angered Lee that he decided on June 27 that he would replace <unk> ; the battle began the next day before he could do so 
 Lee did make plans for an orderly retreat to <unk> 's Point 
The British fleet weighed anchor at Cape Fear on May 31 , and arrived outside Charleston Harbor the next day 
 <unk> noticed a British scout boat apparently looking for possible landing points on nearby Long Island ( now known as the Isle of <unk> ) , just a few hundred yards from Sullivan 's Island ; troops were consequently sent to occupy the northern end of Sullivan 's 
 By June 8 , most of the British fleet had crossed the bar and anchored in Five <unk> Hole , an anchorage between the bar and the harbor entrance 
 With the fort on Sullivan 's Island only half complete , Admiral Parker expressed confidence that his warships would easily breach its walls 
 <unk> believing he would not even need Clinton 's land forces , he wrote to Clinton that after the fort 's guns were knocked out , he would " land <unk> and marines ( which I have practiced for the purpose ) under the guns " and that they could " keep possession till you send as many troops as you think proper " 
The British fleet was composed of nine man @-@ of @-@ war ships : the flagship 50 @-@ gun Bristol , as well as the 50 @-@ gun Experiment and frigates <unk> , Active , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Friendship and the bomb vessel Thunder , in total mounting nearly 300 cannon 
 The army forces in the expedition consisted of the 15th , 28th , 33rd , 37th , 54th , and 57th Regiments of Foot , and part of the 46th 
 On June 7 , Clinton issued a proclamation calling on the rebel colonists to lay down their arms 
 However , the inexperienced defenders fired on the boat sent to deliver it ( which was flying a truce flag ) , and it was not delivered until the next day 
 That same day , Clinton began landing 2 @,@ 200 troops on Long Island 
 The intent was that these troops would <unk> across the channel ( now known as <unk> Inlet ) between Long and Sullivan 's , which the British believed to be sufficiently shallow to do so , while the fleet bombarded Fort Sullivan 
General Lee responded to the British landing with several actions 
 He began reinforcing positions on the mainland in case the British were intending to launch an attack directly on Charleston 
 He also attempted to build a bridge of boats to provide an <unk> of retreat for the fort 's garrison , but this failed because there were not enough boats to bridge the roughly one mile ( 1 @
@ 6 km ) channel separating the island from Charleston ; the unwillingness of <unk> and <unk> to support the effort may also have played a role 
 The Americans also constructed an <unk> at the northern end of Sullivan 's Island , which was manned by more than 750 men and three small cannons , and began to <unk> a guard post at <unk> 's Point on the mainland opposite Fort Sullivan 
General Clinton encountered the first major problem of the attack plan on June 17 
 An attempt to <unk> the channel between the two islands established that part of the channel was at least shoulder @-@ deep , too deep for troops to cross even without the prospect of enemy opposition 
 He considered using boats to ferry the troops across , but the Americans , with timely advice from General Lee , adopted a strong defensive position that was virtually impossible to bombard from ships or the Long Island position 
 As a result , the British and American forces faced each other across the channel , engaging in occasional and largely <unk> cannon fire at long range 
 Clinton reported that this meant that Admiral Parker would have " the glory of being defeated alone 
 " The attack was originally planned for June 24 , but bad weather and contrary wind conditions prompted Parker to call it off for several days 
On the morning of June 28 , Fort Sullivan was defended by Colonel <unk> , commanding the 2nd South Carolina Regiment and a company of the 4th South Carolina Artillery , numbering 435 men 
 At around 9 : 00 am that morning , a British ship fired a signal gun indicating all was ready for the attack 
 Less than an hour later , nine warships had sailed into positions facing the fort 
 Thunder and Friendship anchored about 1 @
@ 5 miles ( 2 @
@ 4 km ) from the fort while Parker took Active , Bristol , Experiment and <unk> to a closer position about 400 yards ( 370 m ) from Sullivan 's Island , where they anchored facing broadside to the fort 
 Each of these ships began to fire upon the fort when it reached its position , and the defenders returned the fire 
 Although many of Thunder 's shots landed in or near the fort , they had little effect ; according to <unk> , " We had a <unk> in the middle , that swallowed them up instantly , and those that fell in the sand in and about the fort , were immediately buried " 
 Thunder 's role in the action was also relatively short @-@ lived ; she had anchored too far away from the fort , and the <unk> of her mortars with extra powder to increase their range eventually led to them breaking out of their mounts 
 Owing to shortage of gunpowder , <unk> 's men were deliberate in the pace of their gunfire , and only a few officers actually aimed the cannons 
 They also fired in small <unk> , four cannon at a time 
 One British observer wrote , " Their fire was surprisingly well served " and it was " slow , but decisive indeed ; they were very cool and took care not to fire except their guns were exceedingly well directed 
At the fort , <unk> ordered his men to concentrate their fire on the two large man @-@ of @-@ war ships , Bristol and Experiment , which took hit after hit from the fort 's guns 
 Chain shot fired at Bristol eventually destroyed much of her rigging and severely damaged both the <unk> and <unk> 
 One round hit her quarterdeck , slightly wounding Parker in the knee and thigh 
 The shot also tore off part of his <unk> , leaving his <unk> exposed 
 By mid @-@ afternoon , the defenders were running out of gunpowder , and their fire was briefly suspended 
 However , Lee sent more ammunition and gunpowder over from the mainland , and the defenders resumed firing at the British ships ; Lee even briefly visited the fort late in the day , telling Colonel <unk> , " I see you are doing very well here , you have no occasion for me , I will go up to the town again 
 " Admiral Parker eventually sought to destroy the fort 's walls with persistent broadside <unk> 
 This strategy failed due to the <unk> nature of the <unk> wood used in its constructions ; the structure would <unk> , and it absorbed the <unk> rather than <unk> 
 The exchange continued until around 9 : 00 pm , when darkness forced a cessation of hostilities , and the fleet finally withdrew out of range 
<unk> casualties , Parker reported 40 sailors killed and 71 wounded aboard Bristol , which was hit more than 70 times with much damage to the hull , yards , and rigging 
 Experiment was also badly damaged with 23 sailors killed and 56 wounded 
 Active and <unk> reported 15 casualties each 
 The Americans reported their casualties at only 12 killed and 25 wounded 
 The following morning , the British , unable to drag the grounded <unk> off the <unk> , set fire to the ship to prevent her from falling into enemy hands 
 <unk> in small boats sailed out to the burning ship , fired some of its cannons at the British ships , took what stores and <unk> they could , and retreated shortly before the ship 's powder magazine exploded 
One iconic emblem of the battle was the flag designed by Colonel <unk> 
 Commissioned by the colonial government , he designed a blue flag with a white crescent in the top left corner , which was flown at the fort during the battle 
 Despite being shot down during the siege , it was seen as a symbol of this successful defense ( and famously raised during victory ) 
 It came to be known as the <unk> flag or Liberty Flag 
 When Charleston ( lost to the British in the <unk> siege ) was reclaimed by American forces at the end of the war , the flag was returned to the city by General <unk> Greene 
Hu lived in <unk> during the transition from the Ming dynasty to the Qing dynasty 
 A Ming loyalist , he was offered a position at the rump court of the <unk> Emperor , but declined the post , and never held anything more than minor political office 
 He did , however , design the <unk> Emperor 's personal seal , and his loyalty to the dynasty was such that he largely retired from society after the emperor 's capture and death in 1645 
 He owned and operated an academic publishing house called the Ten <unk> Studio , in which he practised various multi @-@ colour printing and <unk> techniques , and he employed several members of his family in this enterprise 
 Hu 's work at the Ten <unk> Studio pioneered new techniques in colour <unk> , leading to delicate <unk> of colour which were not previously <unk> in this art form 
Despite his reputation as an artist and seal @-@ <unk> , Hu was primarily a publisher 
 His publishing house , the Ten <unk> Studio , produced reference works on calligraphy , poetry and art ; medical textbooks ; books on etymology and <unk> ; and copies of as well as commentaries on the Confucian Classics 
 Unlike other publishers in the area , the Ten <unk> Studio did not publish works of narrative fiction such as plays or novels 
 This bias towards academia was likely a consequence of the studio 's location : the mountain on which Hu took up residence was just to the north of the <unk> <unk> ( National Academy ) , which provided a captive market for academic texts 
 Between 1627 and 1644 , the Ten <unk> Studio produced over twenty printed books of this kind , aimed at a wealthy , literary audience 
 The studio 's earliest publications were medical textbooks , the first of which , <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) was published in 1631 and proved popular enough to be reissued ten years later 
 Hu 's brother <unk> was a medical <unk> and appears to have been the author of these books 
The Ming dynasty had seen considerable advancement in the process of colour printing in China 
 At his studio , Hu <unk> experimented with various forms of <unk> printing , creating processes for producing multi @-@ coloured prints and <unk> printed designs 
 As a result , he was able to produce some of China 's first printed publications in colour , using a block printing technique known as " <unk> block printing " ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) 
 This system made use of multiple blocks , each carved with a different part of the final image and each bearing a different colour 
 It was a lengthy , <unk> process , requiring thirty to fifty engraved printing blocks and up to seventy <unk> and impressions to create a single image 
 Hu also employed a related form of multiple @-@ block printing called " set @-@ block printing " ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , which had existed since the Yuan period some 200 years earlier but had only recently come into fashion again 
 He refined these block printing techniques by developing a process for <unk> some of the ink off the blocks before printing ; this enabled him to achieve <unk> and <unk> of shades which were not previously possible 
In some images , Hu employed a blind <unk> technique ( known as " <unk> designs " ( <unk> , <unk> ) or " <unk> blocks " ( <unk> , <unk> ) , using an <unk> , <unk> block to stamp designs onto paper 
 He used this to create white relief effects for clouds and for highlights on water or plants 
 This was a relatively new process , having been invented by Hu 's contemporary Wu <unk> , who was also a <unk> @-@ based publisher 
 Wu had used this technique for the first time in his book Wisteria Studio <unk> Paper ( <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , published in <unk> 
 Both Hu and Wu used <unk> to create decorative writing papers , the sale of which provided a <unk> income for the Ten <unk> Studio 
Hu 's most notable work is the Ten <unk> Studio Manual of Painting and <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , an anthology of around 320 prints by around thirty different artists ( including Hu himself ) , published in 1633 
 It consists of eight sections , covering calligraphy , bamboo , flowers , rocks , birds and animals , plums , orchids and fruit 
 Some of these sections had been released previously as single volumes 
 As well as a collection of artworks , it was also intended as an artistic <unk> , with instructions on correct brush position and technique and several pictures designed for <unk> to copy 
 Although these instructions only appear in the sections on orchids and bamboo , the book still remains the first example of a <unk> and analytical approach to Chinese painting 
 In this book , Hu used his multiple @-@ block printing methods to obtain <unk> of colour in the images , rather than obvious outlines or overlaps 
 The manual is bound in the " butterfly binding " ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) style , whereby whole @-@ <unk> illustrations are folded so that each occupies a double @-@ page spread 
 This binding style allows the reader to lay the book flat in order to look at a particular image 
 Cambridge University Library released a complete digital scan of the manual , including all writings and illustrations in August , 2015 
 Said Charles <unk> , Head of the Cambridge University Chinese Department , " The binding is so fragile , and the manual so delicate , that until it was <unk> , we have never been able to let anyone look through it or study it – despite its <unk> importance to scholars 
In 1796 , after three years of the French Revolutionary Wars , Spain and the French Republic signed the Treaty of San <unk> 
 The secret terms of this treaty required Spain to renounce its alliance with Great Britain and subsequently to declare war on its former ally 
 In the East Indies this shift of political allegiance meant that the dominant British forces in the region were faced with the threat of attack from the Spanish Philippines to the east 
 Britain dominated the East Indies in 1796 , controlling the trade routes through the Indian Ocean from the ports of Bombay , Madras and Calcutta 
 Dutch Ceylon , the Dutch Cape Colony and parts of the Dutch East Indies had been captured in 1795 , and the French presence in the region had been confined to Île de France and a few subsidiary islands in the Western Indian Ocean 
Some of the most important trade routes began at <unk> and <unk> in Qing Dynasty China 
 Early in each year a large convoy known as the " China Fleet " , composed of large East <unk> merchant ships in the employ of the British East India Company , sailed <unk> to Europe from <unk> laden with tea and other commercial cargo 
 This convoy was economically significant to Britain : one convoy in 1804 was valued at over £ 8 million ( the equivalent of £ 600 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 as of 2016 ) 
 In January 1797 the convoy had been attacked by the French squadron in the East Indies , comprising six frigates commanded by <unk> @-@ <unk> Pierre César Charles de <unk> 
 In the ensuing <unk> Strait Incident the commander deceived <unk> into believing that the <unk> convoy contained disguised ships of the line and the French admiral retreated , only learning of his error on his return to Île de France 
 There was considerable concern in India that <unk> might try again in 1798 , or that the Spanish , who maintained a powerful squadron at <unk> , might make an attempt of their own 
With his convoy safely at anchor in <unk> and the China Fleet several weeks from sailing , Cooke decided to reconnoitre Manila and make observations on the port and the Spanish squadron based there 
 As an added motivation , rumours in <unk> suggested that the annual Manila galleon was due to arrive 
 This ship brought up to two million Spanish silver dollars from Acapulco across the Pacific Ocean stopping at Guam on its way to Manila 
 <unk> its dollars in the Philippines , the ship then loaded trade goods from the East Indies for the return journey to New Spain 
 This round trip was essential to the maintenance of the Spanish Empire in the East Indies , which operated at an enormous financial loss only <unk> by the substantial subsidy from New Spain 
 Spanish dollars were the accepted currency across most of the East Indies , and disruption of this financial system could have profound effects on regional trade ; but British sailors had nevertheless been attacking the Manila <unk> since Thomas <unk> in <unk> 
Leaving the heavier warships at <unk> , Cooke sailed on 5 January 1798 only with <unk> and Fox , the latter carrying a Mr
 Bernard , an experienced linguist 
 Passing Luzon , Cooke 's ships encountered a small Spanish merchant vessel , which was lured towards the frigates , which were flying French <unk> 
 <unk> the Spanish vessel , Cooke closely questioned the captain and learned that most of the Spanish squadron in Manila were undergoing extensive repairs at <unk> and were unfit to sail 
 Cooke rewarded the captain by releasing his vessel with its cargo intact , although he did remove 3 @,@ 900 silver dollars 
 The Spanish squadron had suffered badly in a typhoon in April 1797 and much of the damage had still not been repaired by the time Cooke 's small squadron arrived off Manila 
 Cooke had taken precautions to disguise his ships as French vessels , modelling <unk> on the powerful 40 @-@ gun Forte and Fox on the smaller <unk> 
Fox was the first British ship into the anchorage , and was consequently approached by the <unk> , whose crew came aboard 
 Malcolm , like Cooke , spoke French <unk> and with Bernard translating was able to persuade the officer in charge that the new <unk> were Forte and <unk> seeking supplies and Spanish reinforcements for commerce raiding operations 
 The officer offered supplies but cautioned that none of the Spanish ships would be in a position to sail until March at the earliest 
 Cooke then joined the party on the deck of Fox , claiming to be Commodore <unk> , a French officer who , unknown to the Spanish , had been killed in the Action of 9 September 1796 off Sumatra 
 The Spanish officer was now completely convinced by the <unk> , which had been augmented by fake French uniforms 
 <unk> the visitor below decks , Cooke then passed wine around and together they drank a series of <unk> , including " the downfall of England " 
For an hour the officers drank , Malcolm and Cooke learning detailed information about the state of the defences and squadron in the Philippines , until a second boat pulled alongside Fox containing more officers keen to <unk> the French <unk> 
 This vessel was the personal barge of the Spanish commander at <unk> , Rear @-@ Admiral Don <unk> María de <unk> , who was not aboard , but who sent a message via an aide in a third boat 
 Each time , the officers were escorted below to join the festivities whereupon their crews were seized at <unk> and taken below decks as prisoners of war 
 In Malcolm 's cabin , the captured officers were informed of their situation , promised release before the British frigates sailed , and offered more wine 
 The crew of Fox meanwhile forced the captured Spanish sailors to strip and <unk> their clothing 
 <unk> into the Spanish boats this party rowed for the mouth of the nearby <unk> River , where they had learned that three heavy gunboats were moored 
 Taking the crews by surprise , the British boarding parties drove off the Spanish without a fight and brought all three boats alongside Fox 
 These vessels normally carried crews of thirty and were well @-@ armed , one with a 32 @-@ pounder long gun and two with 24 @-@ pounder long guns , each supplemented by four <unk> guns 
Cooke led his small squadron past <unk> on 15 January and turned south 
 Four days later in a storm one of the gunboats broke its tow line and was never seen again , lost with its twelve crew 
 The frigates subsequently scouted <unk> before reaching <unk> on 22 January 
 There Cooke raised Spanish colours in an attempt to <unk> the authorities into supplying food and water to his squadron but <unk> grounded on a <unk> at the entrance to the port which raised the suspicions of a <unk> sent by the governor of <unk> , <unk> <unk> 
 The captain of the Spanish boat asked the British ships the names of their captains , and on receiving no answer but a volley of rifle fire , he put the town on alert 
 With the defenders <unk> , Cooke abandoned his <unk> and after <unk> <unk> the following morning , ordered a bombardment of the fort protecting the harbour 
 This had little effect , though later the Spanish recovered at least 450 <unk> from different <unk> , and Malcolm then attempted an amphibious landing in order to storm the <unk> side of the fort 
 The boats came under heavy fire , one smashed by a <unk> , killing two and wounding four 
 Another boat grounded on a <unk> and became stuck ; so with his force in <unk> , as 250 villagers armed with lances ambushed and drove the British from the beach , Malcolm called off the operation 
 After exchanging shot for an hour both frigates cut their anchor cables and retreated out of range , with two dead and one wounded on <unk> and eight wounded on Fox , in addition to those lost in the boats 
 The defenders lost a single man killed and 4 wounded 
With his frigates now requiring repairs , Cooke withdraw half a league from <unk> and spent three days <unk> the masts and rigging of the ships 
 Then he sailed north , scuttling the two remaining gunboats as he did not believe they would survive the return journey to <unk> 
 Four days later , on 27 January the squadron halted at a village named " <unk> " in the north of the Sultanate of <unk> to collect fresh water 
 On the beach a boat party from <unk> was set upon by <unk> tribesmen 
 Two were killed and nine others taken captive and dragged into the forest before rescuers could arrive 
 Cooke complained to Sultan <unk> <unk> at <unk> <unk> and the captured sailors were eventually recovered , although not before <unk> and Fox had sailed for China to escort the merchant convoy back to India 
Cooke 's opportunistic diversion had determined that the Spanish forces in the Philippines posed no immediate threat , although the mission had cost 18 lives : Admiral <unk> later expressed his satisfaction with the outcome in a letter to the Admiralty 
 More might have been achieved with reinforcements : Historian C
 <unk> Parkinson suggests that had Cooke 's squadron united with Resistance together they may have been able to destroy the disarmed Spanish warships at <unk> 
 He also notes however that in this scenario <unk> would have been commanding officer , a man with considerably less imagination and <unk> than Cooke 
 Historian Richard <unk> was critical of the mission , considering the operation to have " no glorious outcome " and citing the failure to capture the treasure ships as its greatest short @-@ coming 
The 1798 China Fleet sailed without further incident 
 During the ensuing year Resistance was destroyed by an accidental explosion in July in the <unk> Strait , and the majority of <unk> 's forces were focused on disrupting the French occupation of Suez in the Red Sea 
 This diversion of British resources created gaps in the coverage in merchant shipping and <unk> was able to send the frigate <unk> and <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> to Manila late in the year to join the repaired Spanish squadron 
 At the beginning of February <unk> , this combined force sailed to <unk> , taking the British defences by surprise 
 The British commander Captain William <unk> <unk> , advancing on the Franco @-@ Spanish force which retreated during the day and disappeared under cover of darkness that evening in the <unk> Archipelago 
 The combined squadron then dispersed and the China Fleet was not attacked again until the Battle of <unk> <unk> in 1804 , at which a French squadron was again driven off in confusion 
 The frigates Cooke had mimicked , Forte and <unk> were sent to operate independently against British trade in the Indian Ocean in early <unk> 
 <unk> was captured by HMS <unk> at the Action of 9 February <unk> near Southern Africa , and Forte was intercepted by HMS <unk> under Cooke on 28 February near <unk> in Bengal 
 In the ensuing battle Forte was captured but Cooke mortally wounded , dying on 25 May 
The sculpture was made from the same <unk> steel ( also known as <unk> @-@ Ten ) as the Angel of the North sculpture , which gradually develops a tightly adhering oxide layer as it is exposed to the elements 
 This layer inhibits further corrosion by reducing its <unk> to water 
 As part of the design , the spikes <unk> slightly in the wind in order to withstand gusts in excess of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) 
 At the time of construction a time capsule was placed in one of the spikes of the sculpture , containing children 's poems and paintings , due to be opened circa 2300 
 The location of the time capsule after <unk> is currently unknown 
The sculpture was constructed in Sheffield by Thomas <unk> Studio , <unk> Lucas , Flint and <unk> and <unk> Structures 
 It was approved at the start of 2003 , with the central core arriving in Manchester on 13 June 2004 
 This was the largest load that could be transferred via road from the factory , and required a police escort 
 This central core was lifted into place in August 2004 , after which the 180 spikes could begin being attached 
 Early estimates had given an optimistic completion date of July 2003 , which contributed to the sculpture gaining the nickname G of the Bang 
The initial phase saw the Australians advance towards the <unk> River 
 Following the end of the early fighting , the Australian advance towards the main Japanese concentration at <unk> continued as they struck out towards the <unk> and <unk> Rivers 
 This continued until torrential rain and flooding brought the advance to a halt short of the objective , <unk> away many bridges and roads upon which the Australians relied for supplies 
 As the Australian advance stalled , the Japanese began harassing the Australian line of communications , and as the rain stopped and the flooding subsided in late @-@ July and into August , the Australians began making preparations to resume the advance towards <unk> again 
 Ultimately , though , the war came to an end before the final Australian advance began , bringing the campaign to an end 
Following the capture of Pearl Ridge in December 1944 , the Australian 7th Brigade had been moved south and allocated to the drive towards <unk> 
 In late March and early April 1945 , they had fought the Battle of <unk> 's Knoll after which a brief lull followed as the Australians paused to shorten their supply lines 
 Meanwhile , the survivors of the Japanese force , heavily demoralised by their defeat , withdrew towards the <unk> River 
 The Australian 3rd Division was then ordered to resume its advance south , being tasked with capturing the <unk> River , while the <unk> was also included as an " intermediate objective " 
 Japanese strength in the southern sector was estimated by the Australians at about 10 @,@ 500 men , of which 2 @,@ 300 were believed to be directly opposing the 3rd Division 
 The 15th Brigade was considered to be the most experienced of the Australian units on <unk> at the time and was moved up to relieve the 7th Brigade , which was in need of rest 
The Japanese forces opposing the Australians belonged to the 6th Division , under the command of Lieutenant General <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> had been ordered to delay the Australian advance between the <unk> and the <unk> for as long as possible , and with these orders in mind he had installed a number of strong points along the Australian 's expected line of advance 
 The division 's infantry had suffered heavily in the previous battle around <unk> 's Knoll and as a consequence , several units had to be reorganized or amalgamated 
 The front line positions were assigned to the 6th Field Artillery Regiment , while the 13th Infantry Regiment was to hold five <unk> to their rear along and <unk> the <unk> Road , designated ' A ' through to ' E ' 
 The 6th Field and 4th Field Heavy Artillery Regiments both held <unk> further back , designated ' F ' and ' G ' 
 The 23rd Infantry Regiment was placed in the rear , where it was being reconstituted following losses suffered during the attack on <unk> 's Knoll 
The 15th Brigade took over the forward positions from the 7th Brigade on 17 April 
 Initial <unk> had the 24th Infantry Battalion on the <unk> Road around <unk> Creek , with the <unk> / 59th around <unk> , north @-@ east of <unk> 's Knoll , and the 57th / 60th , when it arrived to relieve the 9th , would be positioned further east <unk> a secondary , parallel track known to the Australians as the Commando Road 
 Two days later , <unk> received the order to commence the advance towards the <unk> from <unk> , who offered him the support of the 29th Brigade as a mobile reserve in case of sudden counter @-@ attack 
 In a change to the tactics that the Australians had previously employed prior to the fighting around <unk> 's Knoll , from early May they advanced on a two @-@ battalion front , instead of one 
 The 24th Infantry Battalion was in the van , moving along the <unk> Road with the <unk> / 59th protecting its flank and rear ; while 5 @,@ 000 yd ( 4 @,@ 600 m ) further inland the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion , commencing on 3 May , advanced along the Commando Road from <unk> , after taking over from the 9th Infantry Battalion 
Moving forward under a <unk> barrage as they moved beyond <unk> , the 24th Infantry Battalion was the first to contact the Japanese , carrying out an attack against Japanese positions around <unk> 's Creek on 17 April 
 <unk> by a troop of Matilda tanks from the 2 / 4th Armoured Regiment , an artillery barrage which fired over 700 shells , two infantry companies — ' C ' and ' D ' — from the 24th attacked the position while another — ' A ' Company — carried out a flanking manoeuvre to cut another track further north towards <unk> and <unk> 
 The left forward company — ' D ' Company — reached its objective without trouble ; however , ' C ' Company — on the right along with the troop of tanks — came up against stiff Japanese resistance and became bogged down 
 ' A ' Company also became embroiled in heavy fighting along the <unk> track 
 In support of ' A ' Company , <unk> came forward and raked the jungle , hacking through the <unk> to reveal several Japanese <unk> , which were destroyed by the Australian armour 
 As night fell , ' C ' Company dug in before resuming the attack the next morning 
 Engineers were brought forward , as was a <unk> , and the gap was <unk> 
 <unk> heavy fighting , the Australians forced their way across the creek 
 By the time that the position had been taken in the afternoon and the infantry had advanced to the line of exploitation 400 yd ( 370 m ) beyond the creek , 37 Japanese had been killed for the loss of seven Australians killed and 19 wounded 
 After this , the Australians continued their advance towards <unk> Creek , which was a further 1 mi ( 1 @
@ 6 km ) to the southeast 
 In response , the Japanese launched a number of determined counterattacks over the course of the following week , although these were turned back 
 During this time , the Australians sent a number of patrols out in front of their forward elements , one of which managed to slip through the Japanese defensive positions either side of the <unk> Road and carried out a reconnaissance of the <unk> River about 1 @,@ 000 yd ( 910 m ) south of the main crossing 
 Further patrols were carried out , as well as a number of ambushes , before the advance was resumed on 26 April 
<unk> their advance , the Australians were supported by three squadrons of <unk> from the Royal New Zealand Air Force — Nos
 14 , 22 and 26 Squadrons — which bombed and <unk> the ground in front of the advancing infantry , as well as a <unk> barrage of artillery and mortar fire 
 With such strong support the Japanese offered little resistance and over the course of two days the 24th Infantry Battalion covered almost a third of the distance to the <unk> , for just one man wounded 
 Further progress was made over the next week , but on 4 May the advance was slowed when they encountered a roadblock defended by a field gun along with a machine gun , mines and other improvised explosive devices 
 After this , the 15th Brigade 's engineer support were called upon to regularly carry out route clearance and proving operations as the Japanese became increasingly desperate to destroy the Australian armour , to the extent that they were prepared to sacrifice an artillery piece in order to lure the Australian tanks into a trap where they could be destroyed by mines 
 The Japanese began to adapt their tactics in other ways also 
 To <unk> the effectiveness of the Australian tanks , the Japanese began to position themselves off the roads , forcing the infantry to fight without their armoured support 
 Additionally , the Japanese began to concentrate their artillery with increasing accuracy upon the advancing infantry , which they kept under constant observation and fire 
Meanwhile , the previous day , 3 May , the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion had begun operating along the parallel Commando Road to the north 
 Here they had a number of encounters and suffered casualties due to their inexperience in patrolling , which resulted in them being ambushed 
 They also kept up a steady advance and eventually beat the main force in reaching , and crossing the river , arriving there on 6 May 
 On 5 May , along the <unk> Road , the 24th Infantry Battalion had pressed forward again 
 <unk> with a tank troop in support , they came up against a concealed field gun defended by approximately 100 Japanese 
 After the lead Matilda 's machine gun jammed , the field gun opened fire on it , damaging it and wounding its crew 
 Moving around the stricken tank , the second Matilda , armed with a howitzer , opened fire and destroyed the field gun before sweeping the Japanese defenders from the position 
 That night , the Japanese artillery opened up on the Australian position with a heavy barrage , and the following morning put in a company @-@ sized counter @-@ attack 
 The fighting lasted for over two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours , but when it was over the Australians remained in possession of the position having repulsed the attack 
 In doing so , they suffered one killed and nine wounded , while the attacking Japanese had suffered heavily , losing 58 men killed 
 It was the biggest loss since the action at <unk> 's Knoll and it spelt the end of their attempt to defend the <unk> 
The main crossing was planned for 20 May , with the <unk> / 59th Infantry Battalion on the right tasked to cut the <unk> Road and the <unk> Track to the east of the river , while on the left the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion would divert the attention of the Japanese off the 24th Infantry Battalion which would make the main frontal assault from the centre of the Australian line , crossing at the <unk> <unk> , advancing straight up the <unk> Road 
 Preliminary moves began before this , and on 15 May a platoon from the 24th Infantry Battalion along with two tanks attempted to carry out an attack on <unk> 's Ridge 
 After one of the tanks was held up and knocked out by a Japanese field gun , they were forced to withdraw 
 Meanwhile , the <unk> <unk> squadrons — now reinforced by No
 16 Squadron — began an eight @-@ day aerial campaign , attacking along the length of the <unk> and Commando Roads 
 During this period , the New Zealanders flew 381 sorties , while artillery and mortars fired " thousands of rounds " 
In the centre , the main attack along the <unk> Road began at 08 : 30 on 20 May after 20 minutes of <unk> by New Zealand <unk> had prepared the ground 
 <unk> under a <unk> barrage , and with mortar and machine gun support , the 24th Infantry Battalion moved forward with three companies up front and one held back in reserve , along with two troops of Matilda tanks 
 <unk> the forward companies reached their objectives , but one of the companies was halted just short of their objective and was forced to dig @-@ in overnight after coming under heavy small arms and artillery fire and losing four killed and five wounded 
 The attack was resumed the following day , and the Australians were able to advance to the <unk> <unk> ; however , they were prevented from moving any further as the Japanese were still concentrated in large numbers further to the west where an Australian patrol encountered 70 Japanese and were forced to go to ground 
 Finally , a company from the 24th Infantry Battalion was able to move on to the high ground on <unk> 's Ridge , which they found to be heavily mined and booby trapped 
 Engineers and assault pioneers were called up to clear the feature 
On the right flank , the <unk> / 59th Infantry Battalion carried out a wide flanking move along a track that had been carved out of the west bank of the <unk> by <unk> 
 Beginning their move two days earlier , a number of patrols had had contacts with the Japanese 
 Meanwhile , using <unk> to drag the tanks through the mud , the Australian armour had crossed the river also and by 16 : 00 on 20 May the battalion had managed to establish itself in an assembly area to the east of the river , <unk> to the Japanese 
 The following day , the battalion left the line of departure and began to advance on its primary objective , which it reached in the early afternoon despite being held up while the tanks attempted to affect a creek crossing , and further delayed by stiff resistance 
 Later , after one of the battalion 's patrols came under heavy fire , the tanks moved up and attacked a Japanese gun position which the defenders quickly abandoned , leaving behind a 70 mm gun and a large amount of ammunition 
By 22 May , although there were still a number of Japanese in the area which continued to harass and ambush their line of communications , most of the Australian objectives had been secured and <unk> up operations began 
 The last remaining defensive location before the <unk> was <unk> 's Ridge , where the Japanese were sheltering in tunnels 
 A heavy aerial and artillery bombardment devastated the position and forced them to abandon the ridge 
 It was subsequently occupied by a company of Australian infantry 
 Within a short period of time the <unk> Road was subsequently opened , providing the Australians with the means with which to bring up supplies for the next stage of the campaign , being the advance to the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> Rivers 
 The final phase of the battle cost the Japanese 106 killed , while the Australians lost 13 killed and 64 wounded 
During the course of the fighting around the <unk> , the Australians lost 38 men killed and 159 wounded , while the Japanese lost at least 275 men killed 
 Following the battle , the Australians continued their advance towards <unk> at the southern end of the island 
 Throughout the remainder of the month and into June , the 15th Brigade advanced along the <unk> Road , crossing the <unk> on 10 June 
 Beyond the river , the Japanese resolved to hold the food growing areas in order to protect their precarious food supply , and they consequently occupied a series of deep <unk> 
 These were steadily reduced with airstrikes and artillery , and the 15th Brigade subsequently crossed <unk> River before being relieved by Brigadier Noel Simpson 's 29th Brigade in early July 
As the 29th Brigade advanced toward the <unk> River , torrential rain and flooding ultimately brought the advance to a halt 
 The height of the river rose 2 metres ( 6 @
@ 6 ft ) 
 The <unk> Road was reduced , in the words of Gavin Long , " to a sea of mud " and many of the bridges upon which the Australian supply system was dependent were washed away 
 This rendered large @-@ scale offensive infantry operations impossible and as the situation worsened for a period of time the Australians even ceased patrolling operations across the <unk> ; meanwhile , the Japanese continued to harass the Australians , probing their positions and setting mines and traps , targeting the Australian line of communications 
 On 9 July , the 15th Infantry Battalion fought off a series of attacks around <unk> , at the junction of the <unk> River and the <unk> Road , which included a heavy Japanese artillery bombardment 
 Australian patrols were resumed in late July and continued into August 
 These attacks proved very costly , particularly amongst the Australian engineers that were tasked with rebuilding the bridges and roads that had been destroyed in the flooding 
Sonic the Hedgehog is a platform video game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis console 
 The game was first released in North America , Europe and Australia in June 1991 , and in Japan the following month 
 The game features an anthropomorphic <unk> named Sonic in a quest to defeat Dr
 <unk> , a scientist who has imprisoned animals in robots and stolen the magical Chaos <unk> 
 Sonic the Hedgehog 's gameplay involves collecting rings as a form of health and a simple control scheme , with jumping and attacking controlled by a single button 
Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2D , side @-@ scrolling platformer , whose gameplay centers around Sonic 's ability to run at high speed through levels incorporating springs , slopes , high falls , and loop @-@ the @-@ loops 
 The levels contain <unk> in the form of robots ( " <unk> " in the Western game manuals ) inside of which Dr
 <unk> has trapped animals 
 Although destroying a robot frees the animal within , this is not required to complete the game 
 The player must avoid rows of sharp spikes , falling into <unk> pits , being crushed by moving walls or platforms , and drowning ( which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from <unk> ) 
 Sonic 's main attack is his spin , where he <unk> into a ball and <unk> rapidly ( damaging enemies and some obstacles ) 
 This can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground 
<unk> around each level map are gold rings , and collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life 
 <unk> are a layer of protection against <unk> ; if Sonic has at least one ring when he <unk> with an enemy ( or obstacle ) , he will survive 
 However , all his rings will be scattered ; they will <unk> and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again 
 If Sonic is hit without any rings , he loses a life 
 Although shields and temporary <unk> may be collected to provide additional protection , certain <unk> ( such as drowning , being crushed , falling down a <unk> pit or running out of time ) will cost Sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection 
The game is divided into six zones ( Green Hill , <unk> , Spring Yard , Labyrinth , Star Light , and <unk> Brain ) , each with its own visual style and enemies 
 A player must navigate through each zone ( subdivided into three acts ) to progress 
 At the end of each zone 's third act , the player confronts Dr
 <unk> ( who pilots a different vehicle each time ) in a boss fight 
 After the sixth zone , the player continues directly to the Final Zone for a last encounter with <unk> 
In 1990 , Sega ordered its in @-@ house development studio , <unk> , to develop a game featuring a mascot for the company 
 This was a position already held by the character Alex <unk> , but he was considered similar to Mario and deemed unsatisfactory ; Sega president <unk> <unk> wanted a character as iconic as Mickey Mouse 
 Sega had competition from Nintendo and its mascot , Mario , in mind ; Nintendo was dominant at the time , particularly after the release of the successful Super Mario Bros
 3 , and Sega wanted a foothold in the industry 
 Although the company had some success with Genesis ports of its arcade titles , it knew this would not be enough 
<unk> developed ideas for characters , an engine , and gameplay mechanics 
 Development emphasized speed , so <unk> eliminated character designs not associated with fast animals , as well as fast creatures like <unk> and squirrels 
 One idea , a <unk> able to grasp objects with prehensile ears , showed promise at first but was too complex for the available hardware 
 The team narrowed its search to animals that can roll into a ball , their idea for an attacking move 
 <unk> then realized that this would not seem aggressive enough , so they focused on two animals with spikes : <unk> and <unk> 
 The <unk> character , first proposed by <unk> <unk> , prevailed , although the <unk> would later become the basis for Mighty the <unk> ( who first appeared in 1993 's <unk> the Hedgehog ) 
 <unk> has admitted since that he created Sonic 's basic design by combining Felix the Cat 's head with Mickey Mouse 's body 
Sonic was originally <unk> @-@ colored , then a light shade of blue , but he was changed to dark blue so he would stand out against certain backgrounds and to match the Sega logo 
 His shoes were colored red through the inspiration of Michael Jackson 's boots on the album cover for Bad and the outfit of Santa Claus , whom <unk> saw as the most " famous character in the world " 
 Sonic 's spikes were emphasized to make him look <unk> , and he was given the ability to spin while jumping ( so attacking and jumping could be controlled with one button ) 
 The new character was originally named " Mr
 <unk> " , but the eight @-@ member <unk> changed his name to " Sonic " and their studios to Sonic Team 
 <unk> proposed to flesh out the character included placing him in a rock band , giving him vampire fangs , and giving him a human girlfriend named Madonna , but Sega of America scrapped these ideas to keep his identity simple 
 Sega of America also expressed concerns that most Americans would not know what a <unk> is and initially proposed a full @-@ scale recreation of the character , but compromised with Sonic Team to simply make design changes 
 The antagonist ended up being named " Dr
 <unk> " in Japan and " Dr
 <unk> " in other regions as a result of a dispute between Sega 's American and Japanese divisions 
With a satisfying protagonist completed , Sega turned to esteemed programmer <unk> <unk> , who had impressed them through his work on <unk> Star and the Genesis port of <unk> ' n <unk> 
 The gameplay originated with a tech demo by <unk> , who developed an algorithm allowing a sprite to move smoothly on a curve by determining its position with a dot matrix 
 <unk> 's prototype was a platform game with a fast @-@ moving character rolling in a ball through a long , winding tube , and this concept was <unk> out with <unk> 's character designs and levels by designer <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> originally intended to work on the game for three months due to the delay of his planned move to the United States by the outbreak of the Gulf War , but was <unk> in the project for nearly a year 
 His designs for levels were intended to attract both hardcore and casual gamers by integrating occasional challenging set pieces into the mostly accessible level design 
 The game 's color scheme was influenced by the work of pop artist <unk> Suzuki , and the aesthetics of Green Hill were influenced by the geography of California 
In designing the game mechanics , <unk> was inspired by Shigeru Miyamoto , whose games he had enjoyed playing years earlier 
 <unk> the simplicity of Miyamoto 's mechanics in complex environments , <unk> decided that Sonic would be controlled with only a directional pad for movement and a single button for jumping 
 He also wanted his creation to be more action @-@ oriented than the Mario series ; while playing Super Mario Bros
 , he had wondered why the levels could not be cleared more quickly 
 Due to the need to demonstrate the Genesis ' technological prowess , the developing game underwent extensive testing and redesign , a process taking over six months 
 The developers ' efforts were rewarded ; according to <unk> <unk> , the game had the fastest @-@ ever character speed in a video game and a rotation effect in the special stages that was considered impossible on the console 
 The team intended to add a two @-@ player mode displayed via split @-@ screen , but <unk> 's programming knowledge was insufficient to implement this feature 
 However , such a mode would later appear in sequel Sonic the Hedgehog 2 ( 1992 ) , where the second player would control Sonic 's best friend Miles " <unk> " <unk> 
 <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> worked 19 hours a day on the project for several months 
The music for Sonic the Hedgehog was composed and produced by Masato <unk> , bassist and lead songwriter of the J @-@ pop band Dreams Come True 
 The game uses <unk> Yamaha <unk> and <unk> programmable sound generators to produce a variety of <unk> sound effects and music 
 It was originally intended to have a sound test menu with animations of Sonic <unk> to the music of a " Sonic Band " of <unk> <unk> on guitar , Max Monkey on bass , <unk> <unk> on drums , and <unk> the Crocodile on keyboard 
 The playable <unk> became a recurring character in the series , also appearing in <unk> ' <unk> , Sonic Heroes , and Sonic Free <unk> 
 The development schedule scrapped the feature , and <unk> <unk> replaced the test with the " Se @-@ <unk> ! " chant used in TV commercials ( which reportedly used one @-@ eighth of the memory of the four @-@ <unk> cartridge ) 
Game @-@ package illustrator Akira <unk> said that his goal was to make the characters " colorful " , using clear lines and <unk> to " finish them <unk> " 
 According to <unk> , the developers asked him to create a package design " similar to pop art 


 without being particular to conventional packages " – something " original " and " stylish " 
 The game was released in North America , Europe , and Australia on June 23 , 1991 , and in Japan on July 26 
 Sega of America packaged it with American Genesis consoles , replacing <unk> Beast 
 Genesis owners who bought their consoles before the switch could request free copies of Sonic the Hedgehog by mail 
 Sega of America created a large @-@ scale marketing campaign to promote the game and Sonic as a mascot for the company 
A version of Sonic the Hedgehog was developed by Ancient and released in 1991 for Sega 's 8 @-@ bit consoles , the Master System and Game <unk> 
 Its plot and gameplay mechanics are similar to the 16 @-@ bit version , with different level themes and digital assets 
 The level design is <unk> , with no vertical loops , and Sonic cannot re @-@ collect his rings after being hit 
 The game has a different soundtrack , composed by <unk> musician <unk> <unk> and including his compositions and adaptations of music from the 16 @-@ bit version 
 It was the final game released for the Master System in North America 
 The Master System version was re @-@ released for Wii 's Virtual <unk> service in North America on August 4 , 2008 , and in Europe on August 8 
 The Game <unk> version was re @-@ released for the Nintendo 3DS Virtual <unk> on June 13 , 2013 , and included as an <unk> game in Sonic Adventure <unk> : Director 's Cut for <unk> and Windows and Sonic Mega Collection Plus for PlayStation 2 , Xbox , and Windows 
Sonic the Hedgehog has been available for all three major seventh @-@ generation video game consoles 
 It was part of the Wii Virtual <unk> at the service 's 2006 introduction , and was released for the Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network shortly afterwards 
 The game was released for the <unk> Classic , <unk> video , and video @-@ capable <unk> <unk> models in 2007 and for Apple 's iOS service ( compatible <unk> and <unk> touch models ) in April 2009 
 Sonic the Hedgehog became available on <unk> in September 2009 
 In October 2010 , it was released as a Microsoft Windows download which was ported to Steam 
 The game was ported to two online <unk> services ( Google Play and the Amazon <unk> ) in December 2012 
 A remastered mobile port , created using Christian Whitehead 's <unk> Engine previously used in the 2011 <unk> of Sonic CD , was released on iOS , replacing the original port , on May 15 , 2013 with an <unk> version released the following day 
 The port features widescreen graphics , the optional ability to spin dash , a time attack mode , and the <unk> option to play as <unk> or <unk> the <unk> 
 The game was also released as part of the Nintendo 3DS 3D Classics line in May 2013 in Japan , and worldwide in December 
Reviewers noted the game 's colorful , detailed graphics 
 Rand called its color scheme " lively , but never <unk> " , praising the interaction of color with detail in the sprites , backgrounds , and animations and describing its graphics as the best available for the Genesis 
 Reviewer Boogie Man of GamePro called the intricate backgrounds " eye @-@ popping " and " gorgeous " , which was echoed by Mean Machines 
 According to the <unk> ( Hartley , Patricia , and Kirk ) of Dragon , " The graphics and animation in Sonic the Hedgehog make this a serious contender for the best video game of the year " and <unk> called the animation " some of the <unk> and fastest 


 ever seen " 
 The music and sound effects were also well received ; Dragon called them " great " , and <unk> " amazing " 
 Rand noted " <unk> of catchy tunes and <unk> " , calling some of the sound effects " absolutely brilliant " 
 Although Mean Machines called the songs " vaguely appealing " , the game 's sound effects were better appreciated 
Critics cited the fast gameplay , unprecedented in <unk> 
 GamePro 's Boogie Man noted its " lightning @-@ fast action " and , according to Electronic Gaming Monthly ( <unk> ) , " If you thought the Enterprise was quick , wait till you see Sonic at <unk> speed 
 " The game 's difficulty was disputed , described as " impossible " by Rand and " average " by <unk> 
 Rand said about the gameplay in general that it " plays like a dream " ; according to <unk> it would <unk> players for hours , and Boogie Man praised Sonic Team 's ability to provide an engaging experience primarily from running and jumping 
 Although <unk> , Dragon , and Paul of Mean Machines praised the level design ( especially the hidden rooms ) , Paul found losing all of one 's rings frustrating 
Sonic the Hedgehog has maintained its popularity , appearing on lists of the greatest video games of all time 
 Frank <unk> of GameSpot described the game as " one of the best <unk> of all time " , noting that despite technical issues in the Game Boy Advance port " after all these years , the underlying graphics , audio , and gameplay still hold up " 
 Lucas M
 Thomas of IGN agreed that it stood the test of time : " You 'll be impressed by the clarity and color that come through 


 Few people realize how difficult it was to create Sonic 's graphics engine , which allowed for the incredible rate of speed the game 's known for 
 But the technical achievement impressed back in ' 91 , and still does so today 
 " Mega ranked the game its third @-@ favorite Genesis title , and in 2001 Game Informer called it the 24th @-@ greatest game of all time 
 Sonic the Hedgehog has been a commercial success ; the original Genesis version sold over 15 million copies by February 2009 , and the mobile version had eight million paid downloads by 2008 
The game 's success led Sega to develop an extensive media franchise 
 A 1992 sequel , Sonic the Hedgehog 2 , gave Sonic a best friend ( and sidekick ) named Miles " <unk> " <unk> and continued the fight against Dr
 <unk> 
 Sonic has generated dozens of additional games and a large cast of recurring characters ( keeping Sonic and <unk> as <unk> ) , surviving the end of Sega console manufacturing after the <unk> 
 The series has ventured from <unk> to fighting , racing , role @-@ playing , and sports games , and has expanded into anime and manga , cartoons and comic books , novels , and toys 
 Sonic the Hedgehog has become one of the best @-@ selling video game franchises of all time , with over 150 million copies sold by May 2014 
 The game 's first stage , Green Hill Zone , has also been re @-@ <unk> for use in several other titles such as Sonic Adventure 2 , Sonic <unk> and the Super Smash Bros
 series 
" The Same Old Story " is the second episode of the first season of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe 
 The episode was written by executive producer Jeff Pinkner and co @-@ creators J
 J
 Abrams , Alex <unk> , and Roberto Orci 
 When developing the series , they sought to find a medium between serialized drama and the crime procedural 
 " The Same Old Story " was the first regular episode of Fringe , and journalists viewed it as an example of what they could expect from the series 
 It was directed by Paul A
 Edwards 
A prostitute is abandoned by an unknown man at a hospital , dangerously in labor 
 She dies as the doctors perform a <unk> section , but the child ages rapidly in minutes , soon dead having aged to the likes of an 80 @-@ year @-@ old man 
 Olivia Dunham ( Anna Torv ) , Peter Bishop ( Joshua Jackson ) , and Walter Bishop ( John Noble ) , new members of the Fringe division , are called to investigate by division head Phillip <unk> ( Lance <unk> ) , believing the case to be part of " The Pattern " , a string of mysterious incidents 
 The woman is identified as having recently left a local <unk> , and Olivia finds evidence that points to a past serial murder case she and her former partner John Scott were not able to solve 
 Olivia explains to Peter that their murderer would <unk> his victims , young women , then make an <unk> along their face to extract a piece of brain material , killing the victim in the process 
 Walter takes both corpses back to his lab and determines that the woman had only been pregnant minutes before giving birth , her child having accelerated aging disease 
 Walter is reminded of having previously done work in this field , and remembers where he <unk> his car that contains the related files 
 Once they are retrieved , Olivia makes a connection to the <unk> <unk> which controls growth in humans , and informs Charlie Francis ( Kirk <unk> ) to monitor recent cases where the victims ' <unk> <unk> has been removed 
Olivia and Peter turn to an expert in <unk> , Dr
 <unk> ( Mark <unk> ) , to trying to learn more about rapid aging , but Dr
 <unk> cannot help them further , though Peter suspects he is hiding something 
 Unseen by the Fringe division , Dr
 <unk> visits an abandoned warehouse and meets the murderer , Christopher ( Derek Cecil ) , his son , who suffers from rapid aging syndrome 
 <unk> warns Christopher to be careful and that they only need one more woman to complete the process 
 By this time , Charlie has found a recent murder victim killed in the same fashion as Olivia 's serial murderer 
 At Walter 's lab , they identify the <unk> <unk> has been removed 
 They <unk> the murderer must extract hormones from the glands to slow down his own aging process 
 Walter <unk> they can discover the location of the crime by looking at the images left in the woman 's optical nerves induced by the <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> an electronic pulse camera from Massive Dynamic , they discover the image of a suspension bridge near <unk> and identify the likely location from which it was viewed — the same warehouse that Dr
 <unk> visited 
 The FBI converge on the building , and Olivia and Peter find <unk> about to cut into another victim 
 Olivia chases off after Christopher , who eventually <unk> to his rapid aging and dies , while Peter , after <unk> <unk> with a bullet , <unk> with Walter to apply a makeshift <unk> to bring the victim back to life 
Co @-@ creators J
 J
 Abrams , Alex <unk> and Roberto Orci , and executive producer Jeff Pinkner wrote the episode 
 Paul A
 Edwards served as the director , his first such credit for the series 
 In developing Fringe , the co @-@ creators did not want to make the series too serialized , as this was a complaint often directed at Abrams ' television series <unk> 
 They wanted to find a balance between standalone stories and serialized content , and studied procedural dramas such as Law and Order and <unk> : Crime Scene Investigation for inspiration 
 <unk> explained , " While we make sure that our episodes are self @-@ contained – have a beginning , a middle , and an end – the character stories can be serialized 
 They don 't have to resolve themselves over the course of one show 
 " " The Same Old Story " was Fringe 's first regular episode , and some journalists viewed it as an example of how the series would be structured 
The episode was based on actual recent research and involved much collaboration among the series ' different departments 
 For the scene in which they remove the victim 's <unk> , the special effects crew created a mold based on actress Elizabeth Stanley 's head 
 Using plaster to make a prosthetic , they " drilled out the <unk> and <unk> [ ed ] it open and [ went ] through a series of molds 
 " Stanley stated that " it 's really cool to see the head because it really does look just like me , even though it 's very gruesome because the <unk> 's popping out 
 " The prop department rigged a weapon which they called a " <unk> gun " ; according to prop master Peter <unk> , this gun was based on real devices employed in airport security that look through people 's clothing for concealed weapons 
 VFX Supervisor Christopher <unk> explained that for the eye 's last vision , they used " a lot of actual photographic reference on the set and on the location , " which they then used to " take that imagery and composite it into the various computer monitors and displays in the lab 
" The Same Old Story " was watched by 13 @
@ 272 million viewers in the United States , a 45 percent increase of four million from the pilot 
 Fox claimed that this ratings improvement was the best for any new network drama series in over five years 
 Its high @-@ rated lead @-@ in , House , helped boost Fringe 's ratings for the night , as 93 percent of House 's total audience and 95 percent of 18- to 49 @-@ year @-@ olds stayed to watch Fringe 
 Fringe was also the highest rated program for male 18- to 54 @-@ year @-@ olds that evening 
" The Same Old Story " received mixed reviews from television critics 
 TV Squad writer Jane <unk> thought the episode seemed " all over the place " , and wasn 't sure what to think 
 She stated the two most interesting parts of the episode were when Walter removed the girl 's eye in order to identity her killer , and the <unk> at the very end , when Walter states " If you 've read my file , then you know the truth about Peter 's medical history " 
 Travis Fickett of IGN thought it was better than the pilot ; though it was " laden with lots of <unk> <unk> and clichéd dialogue , " Fickett understood that it was needed to <unk> new viewers to the show 
 Fickett concluded his review by saying Fringe has the potential to be a " great show " , and he also praised the production level as " top notch " , and Torv 's performance as " very good " as she " brings a unique presence to the show " 
 The A
V
 Club critic Noel Murray gave the episode a C + , while Television Without Pity graded it with a B
A UGO Networks columnist was concerned that the expensive pilot would be hard to translate into weekly episodes , but " after sitting down to watch Fringe 's second episode , " The Same Old Story " , my concerns have vanished 
 Fringe 's second episode represents all that is holy about genre programming without <unk> any of Fringe 's eleven @-@ herbs and spices 
 In fact , the subtle framework of what makes Fringe not X @-@ Files is even better defined in the first weekly @-@ episode 
 I 'd struggled to find the word to describe it , and the winner is ' <unk> ' 
 " The Same Old Story " has all of the sense of mystery , discovery , and humor that the pilot had just in a smaller , more <unk> space 
 " Another UGO writer , Alex <unk> , later compared " The Same Old Story " to the similarly @-@ plotted The X @-@ Files episode " <unk> <unk> " 
 <unk> concluded that " Fringe wins this one , just for having a slightly less stupid explanation 
A report about the concert at issue released on May 26 , 2010 by <unk> stated that " one of the things that was unexpected was the behavior of the singer Randall Blythe , who on a few occasions struck some fans in a relatively brutal way off the stage 
 " The article also contains pictures , one of them showing Blythe holding a fan down on the ground 
 Meanwhile , another report released two days after the concert by <unk> alleged that " Randy in a totally uncompromising way took down an <unk> fan , who has climbed the podium several times 
 The front @-@ man clearly showed that it is his territory , he struck the intruder down , punched him a couple of times and sent him through the air off the podium , without even stopping singing ( ! ) " On May 28 , 2010 , the report by <unk> stated that " some broken head was a testimony to the fact that the band does not like anybody on the stage " , while <unk> stated that " the only negative thing about the concert was , to say it <unk> , <unk> approach of the band towards the stage @-@ divers 


 when somebody tried to climb the stage , he was brutally swept down 
Following Blythe 's arrest , Tomáš <unk> , a promoter of the concert , said that there was no fight between the fan and Blythe , and that " it was an unfortunate incident which happened during the concert when someone climbed onto the stage where he was not supposed to be 
 " According to the Lamb of God publicist Adrenaline PR , " [ the ] incident deals with a fan that three times during the concert jumped the <unk> and rushed Randy during the performance 
 It is alleged that the third time , security was not able to reach him and that Randy pushed him back into the audience where supposedly he fell and hit his head 
 " However , it was revealed during the trial that it was a different fan who previously got into contact with Blythe than <unk> 
 Guitarist Willie <unk> said , " I can 't recall that particular show , let alone a fan being beaten on the stage 
 I think I would 've noticed something like that considering the <unk> thing 
A police spokesperson stated on June 29 , 2012 that the police had formally charged Blythe under section 146 ( 4 ) of the Czech Criminal Code , which contains intentional <unk> of bodily harm resulting in death ( i
e
 <unk> ) 
 He faced 5 – 10 years of imprisonment if found guilty 
 Randy 's brother Mark Blythe said the charge was " <unk> and <unk> and will be dropped immediately 
On June 30 , 2012 , the State Attorney brought a motion to <unk> Blythe in pre @-@ trial detention , as he considered Blythe a flight risk 
 During a hearing conducted the same day , judge <unk> <unk> of the Prague 8 District Court ruled that Blythe will be held on <unk> , with the possibility of a bail of <unk> 4 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ( ~ US $ 200 @,@ 000 ) , Blythe 's alleged annual income ; Blythe was held in <unk> Prison 
 <unk> was deposited in the court 's bank account on mid @-@ day of July 3 , 2012 
 After this , the State Attorney had three working days to either accept the bail or to challenge it by filing a complaint 
 Due to public holidays it was not until July 9 , 2012 , that the State Attorney filed his complaint , which was to be dealt with by <unk> court , the Prague Municipal Court 
Both the defendant and the State Attorney may appeal the decision ; the appeal would be heard by a panel of the Prague High Court , consisting of three professional judges 
 A decision of second instance court is final and <unk> 
 Nevertheless , an extraordinary appeal may be lodged by the defendant or the Supreme State Attorney , which would be heard by the Supreme Court of the Czech Republic in <unk> ; an extraordinary appeal may , however , rest only on issues of law and does not provide for full review of the case 
 After exhausting all of these <unk> , the defendant may also <unk> a petition to the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic 
 The petition may be based on allegation of violation of rights under the Czech Constitution and Charter of <unk> Rights and Basic <unk> 
<unk> against Blythe was brought by State Attorney <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> had tried a number of murderers , such as <unk> <unk> ( life in prison ) , Roman <unk> ( life imprisonment at 1st instance , 25 years on appeal ) , Maria <unk> ( 13 years imprisonment ) and <unk> <unk> ( 11 years imprisonment ) 
 He also tried a case against <unk> <unk> , an alleged head of Russian mafia , requesting 25 years in prison for ordering a murder 
 The Municipal Court in Prague acquitted <unk> due to lack of evidence ; however , the decision was repealed on appeal by the High Court , and the case will be heard again by a different <unk> of the Municipal Court 
 Another of <unk> 's murder cases which ended in <unk> due to insufficient evidence is that of <unk> <unk> , who was indicted in connection with disappearance of <unk> <unk> , a vice @-@ chairman of the Czech Football Association 
Randy Blythe was represented by Prague lawyers Martin <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> studied law at the Faculty of Law of Charles University and at the New York University 
 From 1990 to 1992 , he served as external advisor of the then Prime Minister <unk> <unk> 
 A former partner at Baker & <unk> , <unk> established <unk> & Co
 in 1996 
 He is also a member of board of directors of <unk> 2000 
<unk> gained fame as attorney of <unk> <unk> , a Kurdish national who was first charged in 1994 with preparing to commit three murders and committing blackmail and torture 
 It became one of the longest criminal cases in the Czech history , as the witnesses and alleged victims gradually withdrew or changed their testimonies against <unk> until he was <unk> by the Municipal Court in Prague in 2007 
 The court held that although the crimes did take place , there is no evidence that <unk> took part in it 
 He was also defending judge Pavel <unk> , who was indicted of accepting a <unk> 
 The proceedings ended with <unk> being found insane and <unk> not liable 
 <unk> also acted as a defense attorney in the case of a <unk> of Czech <unk> indicted on charges of rape and torture 
 During the proceedings , the judge sent <unk> to face the disciplinary commission of the Czech bar association for what he perceived as " behaviour bordering on contempt " 
Blythe , who is <unk> , took off his glasses before entering the stage , which together with the smoke and light effects allegedly left him half @-@ blind 
 Blythe said that people could easily reach the band members or climb up to the stage 
 One of the fans , who was identified as Milan <unk> by Czech newspapers , and who was scheduled to testify later during the proceedings , managed to climb the stage twice without being stopped by security 
 Blythe testified that during the first attempt , <unk> rushed the stage and started waving his arms before stage diving 
 The second time , he tried to put his arms around Blythe in an attempt to <unk> him 
 Blythe , who according to his own words perceived this as a danger , caught <unk> 's collar , pushed him on the ground , <unk> on him and repeatedly told him to stop 
 He then led the fan by his hair to the edge of the stage , where the fan jumped off 
 It was only after watching a video of the incident that Blythe found out that a security officer was actually pushing the fan from back 
 Blythe further said that he saw <unk> trying to reach the stage yet again before finally being stopped by security 
Later , when another fan tried to climb the stage , Blythe thought that it was <unk> again 
 Blythe testified that he approached the fan and pushed him with both hands out of the stage in the belief that the crowd would catch him , which it did not 
 <unk> <unk> , author of video which caught the previous incidents with <unk> , testified that the fan was for a moment lying on the ground with nobody helping him 
 Blythe further commented that he saw the fan get up and that other fans showed him <unk> up 
 Blythe insisted that he never saw <unk> nor came into contact with him 
 It was not until the arrest two years later that he found out about <unk> 's death 
Blythe also alleged that after learning about <unk> 's death , he had written a letter to the <unk> family , in which he offered help and a meeting in @-@ person 
 Daniel <unk> 's father , however , testified that the family has not been contacted by anyone from the band nor by the defense team 
 <unk> 's father confirmed that his son had been healthy up until the day of the incident 
 The <unk> family 's representative brought a claim for damages in the amount of <unk> 10 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ( <unk> 
 US $ <unk> @,@ 000 ) 
<unk> 's friend Jan <unk> testified that <unk> climbed the stage , and as he turned around towards the crowd he was pushed by Blythe off the stage 
 He said he was " 100 % sure Blythe pushed <unk> with both hands 
 " He further said that Blythe 's behavior <unk> from all the concerts he had attended in the past , commenting that Blythe was visibly furious 
 He further claimed that <unk> was not the first person to be chased off the stage by Blythe , with another fan being kicked , choked and receiving a punch from Blythe 
 <unk> corroborated Blythe 's testimony that Blythe asked " Are you okay ? " after <unk> fell and that the crowd gave him a positive reply 
 However , as <unk> fell sick after the concert , they called him an ambulance 
 According to <unk> , the band had not warned the fans against getting on stage and the security guards did not pay much attention to it 
<unk> 's other friend <unk> <unk> testified that <unk> 's fall happened in a break between the end of concert and the encore 
 <unk> climbed the stage together with another fan as the band members were leaving to go backstage 
 According to him , Blythe ran into the two fans and pushed them both off 
 While the other fan was caught by a couple of fans remaining under the stage , <unk> fell directly on the ground 
 According to <unk> , there were fewer fans in front of the stage due to the break 
 <unk> further testified that after the fall , <unk> went to sit on a bench , where he was <unk> a water bottle 
 <unk> began vomiting about half an hour after the fall and as his friends realized that he had a <unk> at the back of his head , they called an ambulance for fear he might have a concussion 
 <unk> said that he understood Blythe 's gesture in the break as an invitation to the stage 
Milan <unk> , the fan whom Blythe admitted to <unk> off the stage , testified on the third day of the trial 
 <unk> said he climbed the stage twice in order to stage dive ; he changed his mind during the third attempt to get on stage 
 <unk> testified that Blythe knocked him down , <unk> on him and held him down for a moment , but Blythe definitely did not <unk> him 
 He also admitted that taking into account the fact that he ( <unk> ) was drunk and the way he acted , Blythe 's reaction was adequate 
 He commented that he grasped the fact that he was not wanted on stage 
The judge also read a sworn statement from <unk> 's former producer , who stated that she had not known about the incident 
 She was aware that an ambulance was called that evening , but learned about the reasons for that only later , during the police investigation 
 The court further heard that Lamb of God had sent a list of security demands to the concert venue , including that barriers should be placed 1 @
@ 5 metres ( 4 @
@ 9 ft ) from the stage 
 <unk> Tomáš <unk> testified that although this was not the case , the band had not expressed any concerns to him either before or after the concert 
Also that day , expert medical witness <unk> <unk> took the stand 
 According to The Prague Post , <unk> testified that <unk> 's cause of death was pneumonia resulting from a blow to the <unk> 
 <unk> added that the " mortality rate from this kind of injury is around 40 percent , and that doctors couldn 't have done more to save the patient 
 " <unk> was initially taken to a nearby hospital less than a kilometer from the venue , where the initial diagnosis took place 
 Since this hospital did not have a specialized <unk> department , <unk> was transferred to another hospital after the diagnosis 
 There , <unk> underwent two operations , first to tend to the injury and second to reduce pressure on brain by removing some bone 
On February 7 , 2013 , only one witness took the stand before the hearing was <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> contacted the defense after reading about the trial in newspapers because he " didn 't like the description of the situation " by the previous witnesses 
 He said he did not think Blythe was aggressive that night , and that fans should realize any aggressive behavior displayed onstage is just part of the show 
 He also said that each time somebody got on the stage , Blythe demonstrated that they were not allowed there 
 <unk> testified that he saw how a fan tried to reach the stage three times and that as he was preparing to stage dive , somebody aided his fall from behind 
 He had not seen anybody fall directly on the ground 
 <unk> had trouble recalling details from the show , as he had visited multiple concerts on other dates in <unk> , and thus could not describe , among other things , the position of the <unk> 
The trial resumed on March 4 , 2013 with testimonies from expert witnesses in the fields of criminal psychology ( <unk> <unk> , appointed by the court ) and <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , appointed by the defense ) 
 Blythe returned to attend the hearings in person , even though the presiding judge had told him that at this point they may be undertaken in his absence 
 The two expert witnesses agreed that Blythe is not aggressive ; nevertheless , he may have issues with controlling his emotions under stress 
 The court further heard testimonies from two <unk> 
 One of them was a bodyguard who was present at the concert but did not see the fall 
 He testified that when by the exit , he saw two men taking a third man out of the building to fresh air 
 He said that he was told by them that the person fell off the stage 
 The ambulance arrived 5 – 10 minutes later 
On July 7 , 2012 , there was a vigil organized in Lamb of God 's hometown of Richmond , Virginia , by a friend of Blythe 's 
 At the event , <unk> ( who are also from Richmond ) frontman Dave <unk> said : “ I don ’ t think it was right for him to be arrested 
 I don ’ t think it was right for him to be locked up 



 This stuff could have all been worked out <unk> or legally before he got there 
 ” In addition to <unk> , other notable figures in heavy metal , such as Tom Araya and David <unk> , have also come out in support of Blythe 
US Highway 2 ( US 2 ) is a component of the United States <unk> Highway System that connects Everett , Washington , to the Upper Peninsula ( UP ) of the US state of Michigan , with a separate segment that runs from <unk> Point , New York , to <unk> , Maine 
 In Michigan , the highway runs through the UP in two segments as a part of the state trunkline highway system , entering the state at <unk> and ending at St
 Ignace ; in between , US 2 briefly traverses the state of Wisconsin 
 As one of the major transportation <unk> in the UP , US 2 is a major conduit for traffic through the state and neighboring northern Midwest states 
 Two sections of the roadway are included as part of the Great Lakes Circle <unk> , and other segments are listed as state @-@ designated Pure Michigan <unk> 
 There are several memorial highway designations and historic bridges along US 2 that date to the <unk> and 1920s 
 The highway runs through rural sections of the UP , passing through two national and two state forests in the process 
The route of what became US 2 was used as part of two Indian trails before European settlers came to the UP , and as part of the Michigan segments of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway and the King 's International Highway auto trails in the early 20th century 
 The state later included these trails as part of M ‑ 12 when the first state highway <unk> were designated in 1919 
 Most of M ‑ 12 was redesignated as part of US 2 when the US Highway System was created on November 11 , 1926 
 Since the 1930s , several changes have <unk> the highway 's routing through the UP 
 One such alteration eventually created a business loop that connected across the state line with Hurley , Wisconsin , and others pushed an originally inland routing of US 2 closer to the Lake Michigan shoreline 
 With the creation of the Interstate Highway System , part of US 2 was rerouted to coincide with the new Interstate 75 ( I ‑ 75 ) , though in the 1980s , the U
S
 Highway was truncated and removed from the I ‑ 75 freeway , resulting in today 's basic form 
According to a 2006 regional planning committee report , US 2 is a key highway for Michigan , providing its main western gateway 
 The roadway plays " an important role in the transportation of goods across the northern tier of states in the Midwest " , and is listed on the National Highway System ( NHS ) for its entire length 
 The NHS is a network of roadways important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility 
 Together with M ‑ 28 , US 2 is part of a pair of primary <unk> that bridge the eastern and western sides of the UP 
 The 305 @
@ 151 miles ( 491 @
@ <unk> km ) of roadway in Michigan is divided into a 109 @
@ 177 @-@ mile ( 175 @
@ 703 km ) western segment and a 195 @
@ <unk> @-@ mile ( 315 @
@ 390 km ) eastern segment , interrupted by a section that runs for 14 @
@ 460 miles ( 23 @
@ 271 km ) in the state of Wisconsin 
US 2 enters Michigan from Wisconsin for the first time north of downtown Hurley , Wisconsin , and <unk> , Michigan , over the state line that runs along the Montreal River 
 The highway crosses the river into <unk> County and passes a welcome center on the way into a commercial district north of downtown 
 Running along <unk> Drive , US 2 meets its only business route in Michigan at Douglas Boulevard 
 The business route was previously a full loop that ran west through downtown <unk> and crossed the border into Hurley and back to the main highway 
 The Wisconsin Department of Transportation has removed the signage on their side of the border , which reduced the loop to a business spur that ends at the state line 
 US 2 continues eastward through UP woodlands to the city of <unk> 
 While bypassing the community of Ramsay , the highway crosses a branch of the Black River 
 The roadway enters Wakefield on the south side of Sunday Lake , meeting M ‑ 28 at a <unk> in town 
 As the US Highway leaves Wakefield , it turns southeasterly through the Ottawa National Forest , crossing Jackson Creek and two branches of the <unk> Isle River 
 US 2 and M ‑ 64 merge and run concurrently over the second branch of the <unk> Isle in the community of <unk> 
 This concurrency has the lowest traffic volume along the entire length of the highway within the state ; in 2010 the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) recorded a daily average usage along the stretch of 770 vehicles , compared to the overall average of 5 @,@ 188 vehicles for the highway 
 At the end of the concurrency , M ‑ 64 turns northerly to run along Lake <unk> 
The highway continues parallel to the state line from the <unk> area through the national forest toward <unk> 
 That unincorporated community is the home of the <unk> High School <unk> , the basketball team featured on a series of ESPN commercials and a documentary series on the Sundance Channel 
 The area is also where the waters meet ; the rolling hills drain to Lake Superior via the <unk> River , to Lake Michigan via the <unk> and <unk> rivers , or to the Gulf of Mexico via the Wisconsin and Mississippi rivers 
 Also located in the area are the <unk> Wilderness , and the Lac <unk> Desert Indian <unk> , which includes the Lac <unk> Desert Casino and Resort 
 The highway travels southeasterly from <unk> around the many lakes and streams in the area and crosses into rural Iron County 
 US 2 intersects Federal Forest Highway 16 ( <unk> 16 ) near Golden Lake in <unk> Township in the middle of the national forest 
 The trunkline then runs along the Iron River as it approaches the city of the same name and meets M ‑ 73 
 In town , US 2 intersects M ‑ 189 before crossing the river and turning northeast out of the city 
US 2 leaves the Ottawa National Forest at Iron River , and the highway continues eastward through forest lands near several small lakes to Crystal Falls , the county seat of Iron County 
 On the west side of town , US 2 meets US 141 ; the two highways run concurrently along Crystal Avenue 
 The combined highway turns south onto 5th Street and meets M ‑ 69 's eastern terminus at the intersection between 5th Street and Superior Avenue next to the county <unk> at the top of the hill 
 US 2 / US 141 runs south out of Crystal Falls to the west of , and parallel to , the <unk> River 
 The roadway passes Railroad , Kennedy and <unk> lakes and leaves the state of Michigan at the <unk> River , crossing into Florence County , Wisconsin for about 14 miles ( 23 km ) 
US 2 / US 141 re @-@ enters Michigan where it crosses the <unk> River and subsequently meets M ‑ 95 in <unk> Township north of Iron Mountain and <unk> 
 The highways merge in a triple concurrency and run south on <unk> Avenue into Iron Mountain along the west side of Lake Antoine , parallel to a branch line of the <unk> and Lake Superior Railroad ( <unk> Railroad ) 
 The road crosses through a retail corridor and over a flooded pit of the <unk> Mine 
 In downtown Iron Mountain at <unk> Street , M ‑ 95 turns west off <unk> Avenue to run across town to <unk> 
 US 2 / US 141 exits downtown and turns east along a second retail corridor near the <unk> Mall 
 The highway re @-@ enters <unk> Township where US 141 separates to the south to re @-@ enter Wisconsin 
 US 2 continues eastward parallel to a branch of the Canadian National Railway ( <unk> Railway ) 
 Both road and rail travel through the community of <unk> , where they pass near the largest paper mill in the UP 
 The trunkline runs along the main street of Norway , where the highway meets the eastern terminus of US 8 
 Then US 2 continues east through rural Dickinson County to Vulcan , passing north of <unk> Lake through the <unk> Country State Forest , before crossing the Sturgeon River in <unk> and passing into <unk> County 
In <unk> County , the environment takes on a more agricultural character along US 2 
 The highway passes through the edge of the community of <unk> before entering Powers 
 US 2 comes to a three @-@ way intersection and turns northeast merging onto US 41 
 The concurrent highway runs from Powers through the communities of Wilson and <unk> on the south side of the <unk> Railway 
 At Harris , the trunkline enters the <unk> Indian Community 
 Harris is on the <unk> County side of the reservation , but as the highway continues east , it crosses over to <unk> River on the Delta County side 
 The county line in between not only separates the two communities , but also serves as the boundary between the Central and Eastern time zones 
 East of <unk> River , the highway crosses the community 's namesake waterway before intersecting the eastern terminus of M ‑ 69 
 The roadway crosses the Ford River prior to turning due east into the outskirts of <unk> 
US 2 / US 41 <unk> to four lanes along <unk> Street , which forms the east – west axis of the <unk> street grid 
 Near downtown , the highway meets M ‑ 35 , which runs along the city 's north – south axis , Lincoln Avenue 
 The <unk> merge and run north , bypassing the traditional central business district for a different business corridor 
 Lincoln Avenue runs north carrying four lanes of traffic past the Upper Peninsula State <unk> , site of one of the two state <unk> for the state of Michigan , the only state to have twin <unk> 
 US 2 / US 41 / M ‑ 35 continues north on Lincoln Avenue past the campus of Bay de <unk> Community College 
 The four @-@ lane highway crosses the <unk> River just upstream from its mouth near the large Mead Paper Mill and shifts to run immediately next to Little Bay de <unk> 
 The section here carried the highest traffic counts along all of US 2 in the state : an average of 23 @,@ 977 vehicles used this segment of roadway daily in 2011 
The road turns inland again , and US 2 / US 41 / M ‑ 35 passes to the west of downtown Gladstone 
 The highway through here is an expressway , four lanes divided by a central median and no <unk> access 
 Unlike a freeway , the expressway has standard intersections and not interchanges 
 The highway intersects the eastern terminus of County Road 426 ( CR 426 ) and crosses the <unk> Railroad south of the <unk> for 4th Avenue North , where M ‑ 35 separates from the US Highways and turns to the northwest 
 The expressway continues north parallel to the <unk> Railway , crossing the Days River 
 Through this area , the trunkline carries a speed limit of 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) for car traffic 
 This is the only road in the UP with a speed limit higher than 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) besides I @-@ 75 , which has a speed limit of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) 
 The expressway segment runs around the upper end of Little Bay de <unk> before ending at Rapid River 
 In this location , US 41 separates to the north , and US 2 returns to an easterly track as a two @-@ lane road , crossing the Rapid and <unk> rivers and turning southeast around the head of the bay 
 As US 2 crosses southern Delta County , it passes through the western unit of the <unk> National Forest 
 Near Garden Corners , the highway runs along the shore of Big Bay de <unk> 
 After the intersection with the northern terminus of M ‑ 183 , US 2 turns inland cutting across the base of the Garden Peninsula and enters Schoolcraft County 
As the highway approaches Thompson , US 2 leaves the western unit of the <unk> National Forest and enters the Lake Superior State Forest 
 The roadway runs along Lake Michigan to <unk> , crossing the <unk> River 
 The trunkline turns inland approaching <unk> and then turns north @-@ northeast to Blaney Park 
 The community there is a former logging town @-@ turned @-@ resort at the southern terminus of M ‑ 77 ; the resort was active from the late 1920s but declined by the 1980s 
 From Blaney Park , US 2 turns due east and crosses into Mackinac County west of Gould City 
 Where it intersects a former routing , the main highway crosses the <unk> Railway one last time and runs to the south of <unk> to follow the Lake Michigan shoreline through <unk> 
 After passing the community of <unk> , US 2 crosses the Cut River Bridge , 147 feet ( 45 m ) over the Cut River 
 The highway crosses into the eastern unit of the <unk> National Forest near <unk> , running between Lake Michigan and <unk> Lake in the process 
 The road continues along the Lake Michigan shoreline , passing <unk> Spot near <unk> Cap and turning inland immediately west of St
 Ignace 
 The US 2 designation ends at the highway 's partial cloverleaf interchange with I ‑ 75 
 The roadway continues easterly into downtown St
 Ignace as Business Loop I ‑ 75 ( BL I ‑ 75 ) 
In 1701 , the first transportation routes through what became the state of Michigan were the lakes , rivers and Indian trails 
 Two of these trails followed parts of the future US 2 
 The <unk> – Green Bay Trail roughly followed the Lake Michigan shoreline routing of US 2 between <unk> and St
 Ignace 
 The Mackinac Trail connected St
 Ignace with <unk> <unk> 
 Marie 
In the age of the auto trail , the roads that later formed US 2 through the UP were given a few different highway names 
 When the original roadways between <unk> and Iron River were completed in late 1915 , the Upper Peninsula Development Bureau ( <unk> ) named the area <unk> and the highway the <unk> Trail 
 Later the name was extended over the highway to <unk> , and to all highways in the area in the early 1920s ; the name was phased out by the <unk> completely in 1927 
 The roadways were also used for the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway , named for former US president Theodore Roosevelt after his death in 1919 
 Overall , this highway ran from Portland , Oregon , to Portland , Maine , by way of Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario 
 Through the UP , the southern branch followed the immediate predecessors to US 2 , including the section through Florence County , Wisconsin 
The Great Lakes Automobile Route was established in 1917 by the <unk> 
 A predecessor of the Great Lakes Circle <unk> by seventy years , the route followed " a circular journey along the banks of lakes Michigan and Superior and Green Bay 


 " This route followed the modern US 2 from <unk> to the M ‑ 94 junction in <unk> , using the modern M ‑ 69 and M ‑ 95 to stay in Michigan 
 <unk> of the route followed US 41 and M ‑ 35 between Powers and <unk> 
 The route was originally intended to entice motorists to drive around Lake Michigan 
 The name fell out of use before its first anniversary because of World War I
One Canadian auto trail was routed through the UP as well 
 In 1920 , the King 's International Highway linked Vancouver , British Columbia , to Halifax , Nova Scotia , but there was no highway to carry it around the north side of Lake Superior 
 <unk> had to ship their cars by boat between <unk> <unk> 
 Marie , Ontario , and Thunder Bay or enter the United States to continue along the auto trail 
 The <unk> varied on the maps of the time , but its basic route used US 2 through the UP from <unk> to <unk> <unk> 
 Marie until a highway north of Lake Superior was opened in 1960 ; by that time , the auto trail had taken on the Trans @-@ Canada Highway name 
The first state trunkline highway designated along the path of the modern US 2 was M ‑ 12 , a designation that was in use by July 1 , 1919 , between <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 Marie 
 The first roadside park in the country was created by Herbert <unk> near what is now US 2 near Iron River in 1919 – 20 , although other sources state that the first was a picnic table alongside US 16 ( Grand River Avenue ) in 1929 south of <unk> 
 When the US Highway System was created on November 11 , 1926 , US 2 partially replaced M @-@ 12 
 Between Crystal Falls and Iron Mountain , US 2 was routed through Florence , Wisconsin 
 The former routing of M ‑ 12 from Crystal Falls to <unk> became a new M ‑ 69 when the former M ‑ 69 became US 102 ( now US 141 ) 
 M ‑ 12 from <unk> south to Iron Mountain was made a part of an extended M ‑ 45 , which is now M ‑ 95 
 By the next year , M ‑ 48 was added along US 2 from <unk> to <unk> as part of a larger extension 
The first changes to the routing of US 2 itself were made in 1930 with a bypass of downtown <unk> 
 A larger <unk> was completed in 1933 between Rogers Park and <unk> <unk> 
 Marie 
 The new routing followed Mackinac Trail instead of turning east to <unk> and north to <unk> <unk> 
 Marie ; the former routing was given the M ‑ 121 designation 
 Another realignment in the Iron Mountain area shifted US 2 / US 141 to a new bridge over the <unk> River between 1932 and 1934 
 Downtown <unk> was bypassed in 1934 , and the former route was initially designated M ‑ 54 
The MSHD started construction in 1936 on a new road that rerouted US 2 into St
 Ignace for the first time 
 Between <unk> and <unk> , US 2 previously followed Worth Road inland to the <unk> Trail to meet the northern extension of US 31 into the Upper Peninsula 
 The new routing took US 2 along the <unk> into St
 Ignace 
 US 31 was truncated to the state ferry docks in Mackinaw City and US 2 was routed through St
 Ignace along the former US 31 to Rogers Park ; the connection in St
 Ignace to the state ferry docks became M ‑ 122 
 Further changes in the early 1940s <unk> the roadway out near <unk> and Crystal Falls 
Additional <unk> were completed by the MSHD to move US 2 to its modern <unk> routing between Gould City and <unk> in 1941 
 The new highway traveled due east from Gould City to <unk> and then along the lake to <unk> 
 The former route through <unk> was turned back to local control as far east as <unk> 
 From there east , it was numbered just M ‑ 48 , removing US 2 from a concurrency 
 Another former section into <unk> was added to extend M ‑ 117 
 The new highway was <unk> around the Cut River Bridge until it was completed in 1946 after construction delays over steel shortages during World War II 
The western end of US 2 took on two changes in the 1940s 
 M ‑ 28 was extended along US 2 to the state line at <unk> from its western terminus at Wakefield 
 A similar extension was made from M ‑ 28 's eastern terminus to <unk> <unk> 
 Marie in 1948 
 The M ‑ 54 designation was renumbered as Business US 2 by 1945 
 The eastern M ‑ 28 extension was reversed in 1950 , and the western extension to the state line was shifted to a new location by 1952 
With the coming of the Interstate Highway System in Michigan , the MSHD planned to convert the eastern section of US 2 to a freeway between St
 Ignace and <unk> St
 Marie 
 In planning maps from 1947 , this highway corridor was included in the system that later became the <unk> 
 It was also included in the General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas <unk> in September 1955 , or Yellow Book after the cover color , that was released in 1955 as the federal government <unk> plans for the freeway system 
 The proposed number in 1958 was Interstate 75 ( I ‑ 75 ) 
The first section of freeway was built in late 1957 or early 1958 between <unk> <unk> and M ‑ 123 north of St
 Ignace 
 The Mackinac Bridge was opened to traffic on November 1 , 1957 ; a new section of freeway and an interchange connected US 2 to the bridge 
 In 1961 , another new freeway segment closed the gap between the Mackinac Bridge and <unk> <unk> sections 
 At the time , the I ‑ 75 designation <unk> US 27 on the bridge , and US 2 was shifted to follow I ‑ 75 along the freeways in the St
 Ignace area 
 The former routing of US 2 in downtown St
 Ignace was redesignated BL I ‑ 75 
 More sections of freeway were opened in 1962 immediately to the south of the newly constructed International Bridge in <unk> <unk> 
 Marie as well as between <unk> and <unk> 
 The last two sections opened in 1963 connected the northern end of the freeway at M ‑ 123 to <unk> , and the section between <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 Marie 
 At this time , all of US 2 's former routing became a county road known as Mackinac Trail ( H @-@ 63 ) 
The Department of State Highways expanded US 2 / US 41 into an expressway between Gladstone and Rapid River in 1971 
 The state built a new bridge over the <unk> River in 1983 , bypassing downtown 
 MDOT disposed of the former routing of US 2 into downtown in two ways 
 The western half was initially an unnumbered state highway until it was later transferred to local control 
 An extension of M ‑ 94 replaced the remainder , including the <unk> Bridge , through downtown 
 In that same year , the department truncated US 2 to end in St
 Ignace by removing it from the I ‑ 75 freeway 
 The last changes were made to US 2 's routing through Iron River in 1998 , bypassing the bridge that formerly carried the highway over the river in town 
 In 2011 , MDOT raised the speed limit along the expressway section in Delta County from 55 to 65 mph ( 89 to 105 km / h ) , although the speed limit for trucks remains 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) 
On July 1 , 1924 , the State Administrative Board named M ‑ 12 , the predecessor to US 2 in Michigan , the <unk> Highway to honor Frank P
 <unk> , a prominent local citizen who later served in Congress from 1927 to 1933 
 In 1929 , the residents of <unk> created a memorial to the veterans of World War I called Memory Lane 
 The project consisted of <unk> and maple trees planted along US 2 / US 41 west of town 
 The American Legion sold the trees to local businesses and individuals who could honor specific soldiers 
 Later in 1949 , the <unk> Women 's Club created a tribute in the form of a permanent living memorial to the area veterans 
 Also called Memory Lane , the group planted 140 <unk> and 1 @,@ 840 <unk> , trees and shrubs as a <unk> parkway along 2 @
@ 3 miles ( 3 @
@ 7 km ) of US 2 east of <unk> 
Two sections of US 2 are part of the overall Great Lakes Circle Tour ( <unk> ) : the segment from the Wisconsin state line near <unk> to the M ‑ 28 junction in Wakefield is part of the Lake Superior Circle Tour ( <unk> ) , and the segment from the southern M ‑ 35 junction in <unk> to the eastern terminus in St
 Ignace is part of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour ( <unk> ) 
 These two tours were created in May 1986 through a joint effort between MDOT and its counterparts in Wisconsin , Minnesota and Ontario 
 The section of US 2 between Iron River and Crystal Falls has been named the Iron County Heritage Trail 
 This Pure Michigan Byway was designated to honor the " rich history of two industries that built a state and nation : mining and logging 
 " On August 26 , 2007 , MDOT announced that the section of US 2 that runs concurrently with M ‑ 35 in Delta County was being included in the UP <unk> Coast Recreational Heritage Trail 
There are six bridges along current or former sections of US 2 that MDOT has added to its listing of Michigan 's Historic Bridges ; two of these are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places ( <unk> ) 
 A third bridge added to the <unk> in late 2012 has not been added to MDOT 's listing however 
 The first of these historic bridges is the crossing of the Iron River , which has since been bypassed by a new bridge 
 The original structure , dating to 1918 , is a 55 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 17 m ) <unk> arch span that was built by the MSHD as Trunk Line Bridge No
 191 
 The structure was listed on the <unk> on December 9 , 1999 , for its architectural and engineering significance 
In December 2012 , the National Park Service approved the listing of the Upper Twin Falls Bridge that crosses the <unk> River northwest of Iron Mountain 
 The structure is a single @-@ span , pin @-@ connected , <unk> , through @-@ <unk> bridge , and it is the only known example of its type in Michigan 
 It was built between 1909 and 1910 because the Twin Falls Power Dam would flood an existing river crossing 
 The span cost $ 5 @,@ 106 ( equivalent to $ 780 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) , paid equally by Dickinson and Florence counties 
 Until the 1930s , the Upper Twin Falls Bridge carried US 2 across the <unk> River 
 In 1934 , a new bridge was built about a mile downstream , and the highway was rerouted over the new span 
 The bridge closed to automobile traffic in September 1971 , and the nomination process for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places began in 2012 
Before 1983 , US 2 used a different routing through <unk> and crossed the <unk> River on what is nicknamed the " <unk> Bridge " 
 Built as a part of a <unk> <unk> on the river , the water level is actually higher than the road surface 
 This produces a <unk> effect , giving the bridge its nickname 
 The <unk> <unk> and Paper Company was organized in 1916 and needed a dam on the <unk> River to supply their mill 
 This dam would require a large section of the city to be flooded , and shallow river banks meant difficulties in any bridge construction 
 Instead of expensive <unk> , a concrete tank was built <unk> in the river bed ; the sides of this tank provided man @-@ made banks higher than the natural banks 
 The Michigan Works Progress Administration described the bridge as having " concrete bulkheads , formed by the side spans of the bridge , [ that ] allow the mill to maintain the water level several feet above the roadbed 
 " The <unk> Tourism Council stated : " At one time , the bridge itself was partially supported by the water that was <unk> forced under it , " and that the bridge has been featured in Ripley 's Believe It or Not ! 
 The eight @-@ span structure is <unk> feet ( 90 m ) long 
The Cut River Bridge carries US 2 across the Cut River in <unk> Township , Mackinac County 
 This structure was built during World War II but completion was delayed due to war @-@ induced steel shortages 
 The span uses <unk> short tons ( <unk> long tons ; <unk> t ) of structural steel to bridge the <unk> feet ( 195 m ) over the river and its <unk> at a height of 147 feet ( 45 m ) above the river 
 The Cut River Bridge is one of only two <unk> deck <unk> bridges in the state 
 On either side of the bridge , there are picnic areas and trails down to the river 
Listed on the <unk> on December 17 , 1999 , the Mackinac Trail – <unk> River Bridge carries H @-@ 63 , the modern successor to US 2 , over the <unk> River north of St
 Ignace 
 The bridge is another <unk> arch structure 60 feet ( 18 m ) in length and built in 1920 
 Increasing traffic along Mackinac Trail prompted the MSHD to " widen its deck by five feet [ 1 @
@ 5 m ] and install new <unk> in the 1929 – 1930 <unk> " along with the addition of decorative retaining walls 
Business U
S
 Highway 2 ( Bus 
 US 2 ) is a 1 @

@ <unk> km ) business route that runs from the Wisconsin state line at the Montreal River 
 The route extends through downtown <unk> on Silver and Aurora streets before turning northward along Suffolk Street 
 Bus 
 US 2 stays on Suffolk Street for a short while until it turns onto Frederick Street 
 On Frederick Street , Bus 
 US 2 bears north through a residential area along Douglas Street 
 The eastern terminus of the route is at its junction with US 2 at the corner of <unk> Drive and Douglas Street north of downtown 
The Butterfly World Tour was the third concert tour by American singer @-@ songwriter Mariah Carey 
 The tour promoted Carey 's album at the time , Butterfly ( 1997 ) , and included songs from several of her previous albums 
 The tour visited Asia , Australia and the United States , with rehearsals taking place in December 1997 
 Starting on January 11 , 1998 the tour spanned five shows in Asia , six in Australia , and one in Hawaii , US 
 Throughout the tour , Carey varied hairstyles and outfits , as well as song selections 
 The Butterfly World Tour was very successful ; the four dates at Japan 's largest stadium , Tokyo <unk> , sold out in under one hour , <unk> over 200 @,@ 000 tickets , breaking the previous record she held at the stadium for show sell @-@ outs 
The tour was recorded in VHS format , and was titled Around the World 
 The video featured live performances of Carey at different worldwide venues including New York , Japan , Hawaii and Brisbane 
 Other scenes are included in the video such as a conversation between Carey and Brenda K
 Starr prior to her performance of " I Still Believe " 
 Prior to the performances in Australia , a scene of Carey swimming with <unk> is shown 
 Additionally , Olivia Newton @-@ John makes a cameo appearance during their joint performance of Newton @-@ John 's song , " <unk> <unk> to You " 
 The video was commercially successful , being certified platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) and gold in Brazil by the <unk> <unk> dos <unk> de <unk> ( <unk> ) 
Since her debut in 1990 , Carey had not journeyed on a large or extensive tour 
 In fact , she had not embarked on a tour until her third studio effort , Music Box ( 1993 ) , when she performed six arena shows in the United States during the Music Box Tour 
 The opening night of the tour received scathing reviews , mostly aimed at Carey 's deemed " obvious " stage @-@ <unk> and failure to make a connection with the crowd 
 <unk> nights were more favorably reviewed , with critics raving about Carey 's vocals 
 Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote regarding Carey 's live vocals , " Beyond any doubt , Ms
 Carey 's voice is no studio <unk> 
 Her range extends from a rich , <unk> alto to dog @-@ whistle high notes ; she can linger over sensual turns , <unk> with <unk> confidence , <unk> like a <unk> singer 
 " However , after the strong media attention , Carey did not visit the US on her succeeding Daydream World Tour in 1996 , visiting only Europe and Asia 
 The tour in contrast , received critical acclaim from critics and fans alike , as well as breaking ticket sale records 
 Carey 's three shows at Japan 's largest stadium , Tokyo <unk> , sold out in under three hours , <unk> in over 150 @,@ 000 tickets , setting the record of fastest show <unk> in Japan 's history 
 On the Butterfly World Tour , Carey broke the record , selling 200 @,@ 000 tickets in under one hour 
 During 1997 , after the commercially and critically successful release of Butterfly , Carey had not planned to tour once again , due to the long travel times and strain on her voice 
 However , due to overwhelming demand by fans , Carey agreed to perform in Asia once again , only extending the tour to Taiwan and Australia , as well as one last show in the United States 
 <unk> for the show began shortly after Christmas 1997 , extending for a period of two weeks 
The show began with Carey standing on a small elevated centerpiece on stage , surrounded by several long draped <unk> 
 Carey featured three background vocalists throughout the tour , Trey Lorenz , <unk> Daniels and Kelly Price 
 As the introduction began with " <unk> " , each of the <unk> were slowly draped , revealing Carey atop the platform , dressed in a beige mini @-@ dress and matching sheer <unk> and <unk> heels 
 As she began performing " <unk> " , the platform was lowered so Carey could access the other sections of the stage throughout the song 's performance 
 After an intimate performance with <unk> lights for " The Roof ( Back in Time ) " , Carey was joined on @-@ stage by a Peruvian guitar player , who played the Latin @-@ inspired guitar melodies during her performance of " My All " 
 Afterwards , Carey sang " Close My Eyes " , the only sitting performance of the show 
 During the song , several male backup dancers performed slow and ample dance routines behind Carey on a higher level of the stage 
For the second part of the show , Carey had the second costume change of the evening , donning a long <unk> black gown and semi @-@ <unk> hair 
 For the performance of " <unk> " , Carey was joined by three female back @-@ up dancers , who mimicked her light dance routines during the song 
 The next song on the set @-@ list was " Hero " , which featured Carey alone on @-@ stage , without any vocal back @-@ up 
 After the song 's performance , Carey was joined on @-@ stage by Lorenz , who performed " I 'll Be There " alongside her 
 Next came " Make It <unk> " , a song which accompanied yet another wardrobe change for Carey 
 She <unk> a short mini @-@ skirt , alongside a <unk> white <unk> and loose golden <unk> 
 On @-@ stage , Carey was joined by a full church choir , all dressed in long black garments 
 After the song 's <unk> , Carey performed " One Sweet Day " , alongside a previously recorded video of Boyz II Men during their live performance of the song with Carey at Madison Square Garden in 1995 
After completing the song , Carey changed to a pair of leg @-@ hugging blue <unk> and a tank top 
 Her next performance was the " Fantasy " remix , featuring <unk> ' Dirty <unk> on a large projection screen behind the stage , as Carey performed light chair dance @-@ routines alongside several male dancers 
 The performance featured the most intricate choreography Carey performed on the tour 
 After a low @-@ key performance of " <unk> " , or " Whenever You Call " in other countries , Carey was once again joined by several male dancers , as she sang " <unk> " , while re @-@ <unk> the music video during a small <unk> 
 Carey once again changed to a beige ensemble similar to her first outfit before performing her debut single , " Vision of Love " 
 The final song on the tour was " Butterfly " , which featured large <unk> of butterflies and flowers projected onto the large screen behind Carey 
 She <unk> a long brown <unk> gown for the performance , being joined on stage once again by her trio of back @-@ up singers 
 During the shows in Japan , Carey performed her holiday classic " All I Want for Christmas Is You " , alongside various male and female dancers on stage who performed light dance routines alongside Carey 
 During the song , Carey <unk> a Santa suit and matching hat , while being carried on a large stage prop by the dancers 
During the tour , several bits and performances were filmed and later edited into a VHS and DVD entitled Around the World 
 The VHS featured performances from Tokyo <unk> , <unk> Stadium as well as few other <unk> and scenes that were later compiled into the video 
 The film first begins with performances in Hawaii , where the song 's recitals are cut into halves , excluding the second verses and bridge to shorten the bulk length of the video 
 Afterwards , Carey 's performance of " My All " is shown in inter @-@ cut scenes from Japan and <unk> 
 After the conclusion of the song , scenes of Carey conversing with Brenda K
 Starr are shown , which eventually lead to a tribute to her at a small and intimate New York club , where Carey performs " I Still Believe " 
 Soon after , Carey 's performance in Japan with Lorenz for " I 'll Be There " is shown , leading to scenes of Carey swimming with <unk> in <unk> the next title on the video is Carey 's live rendition of " <unk> <unk> To You " , where she is joined by Olivia Newton @-@ John on stage in Melbourne 
 A scene of a fans gathering outside of a New York City studio is shown , following a performance of " <unk> , " and " Hero " at <unk> Stadium 
 The VHS was a commercial success , being certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) , denoting shipments of over 100 @,@ 000 units 
 The video was also certified gold in Brazil by the <unk> <unk> dos <unk> de <unk> ( <unk> ) 
The <unk> at <unk> was built by <unk> George <unk> for William Button in 1819 
 It replaced a post mill which had been moved to Sandy Lane , <unk> , Norfolk the previous year 
 The mill was set to work on Christmas Day 1819 
 In 1832 , the mill was modernised by the fitting of a cast @-@ iron <unk> , Patent sails and a <unk> 
 The new <unk> was fitted on 16 July 1832 
 It was made by J <unk> , the Kings Lynn <unk> , and weighs 1 <unk> tons ( 1 @,@ 780 kg ) 
 A new stock was fitted in September 1836 
 William Button died on 11 February 1837 
 The mill passed jointly to his widow Rebecca and their son Richard 
 Richard Button worked the mill until 1860 , at which date it was conveyed to his sons Richard and William , who sold it to Richard <unk> from <unk> , Norfolk in 1862 
The mill was worked by Stephen <unk> , Richard 's son 
 He inherited the mill on the death of his father in 1875 and leased it to Henry Bryant in 1879 
 In 1884 , the mill was sold by auction , and Henry Bryant purchased the <unk> 
 Bryant rebuilt the floors of the mill 
 From 1892 , a portable steam engine was used as auxiliary power , driving an extra pair of <unk> on the ground floor 
 This was replaced in 1914 by a <unk> oil engine 
 Bryant ran the mill until 1920 when he sold it to <unk> Vincent , a retired <unk> from <unk> , Norfolk 
 The <unk> engine was sold in the early 1920s 
 The mill was <unk> <unk> , and as a result one pair of sails was removed 
 Vincent carried out some repairs to the mill and ran it until he retired in 1924 
 One of the remaining two sails was wrecked in 1926 when the mill was again <unk> 
On the death of <unk> Vincent in 1932 , his son George inherited the property 
 He lived at the site in an old <unk> until his death in 1973 
 The mill passed to his daughter , who sold it in 1974 to Mr and Mrs <unk> , who intended to convert it into a house 
 They later changed their minds and offered it for sale for restoration 
 In 1976 , the cap of the mill was blown to pieces in a gale 
 <unk> <unk> was purchased by five members of the Suffolk Mills Group in November 1979 , and plans for restoration were made 
 The consortium consisted of Mark <unk> , Charles <unk> , Peter <unk> , David <unk> and Chris <unk> 
 The <unk> mill and an acre of land cost £ 6 @,@ 000 
The consortium took possession of the mill in November 1979 
 The first priority was to make the mill as <unk> as possible 
 <unk> sheets were spread on the dust floor of the mill to prevent further water penetration of the structure 
 The mill was surveyed and recorded 
 In spring 1980 , the dust floor partially collapsed and was removed as a safety measure 
 <unk> was erected to allow the <unk> to be dismantled , and the cap centering wheels were removed in preparation for the removal of the cap frame 
New oak <unk> were laid on the dust floor and temporary boarding laid to provide a working platform for repairs to the top of the mill tower 
 The bin floor was removed , apart from one oak main beam which was <unk> 
 A replacement main beam was made from pitch pine , and the oak beam was repaired 
 New oak <unk> were fitted , along with some salvaged from the original floor which were fit to be reused 
 One of these had previously been a whip from a Common sail 
 Some of the <unk> were made from pitch pine from the <unk> <unk> , which , following its collapse on 19 February 1977 , had been re @-@ erected at the Museum of East Anglian Life , <unk> 
 The <unk> hoist was dismantled to enable its repair , brickwork was repaired , and new <unk> were made for some of the windows 
 A <unk> was secured over the mill tower to keep the weather out over winter 
 The <unk> on the bin floor were replaced and one of the two pairs of <unk> was removed 
The <unk> were removed from the stone floor , which was then repaired 
 One of the main beams was found to have been attacked by Death Watch beetles , and over a third of the <unk> beam was replaced with oak 
 The six supports for the <unk> frame were repaired one at a time , as they bore the whole of the weight of the machinery above 
 One post required replacement 
 It had <unk> and the floor had sunk by 4 inches ( 100 mm ) causing the second main floor beam to fracture 
 When this work had been completed , the stone floor was removed , including the second main floor beam , which was removed in one piece so that the most suitable route to install its replacement could be assessed 
The new main beam for the stone floor was installed and the ground floor was <unk> 
 The stone floor was reconstructed , reusing the old stone bearers and those <unk> that were fit for reuse 
 Other <unk> were made new from oak or pitch pine 
 New <unk> were laid in the dust floor , the 1 1 ⁄ 4 inches ( 32 mm ) thick <unk> boards being double @-@ grooved with a metal tongue between them 
 Those on the bin floor are of a similar configuration 
 The top four courses of brickwork of the mill tower were removed and work began on rebuilding them , aided by a <unk> attached to the upright shaft 
During the second work @-@ in , the remainder of the stone floor was boarded , again using double @-@ grooved boards with a metal tongue between them 
 The window on the dust floor was rebuilt and the reconstruction of the top four courses of brickwork continued 
 The top two courses were rebuilt with red engineering bricks 
 The dust floor window had a reinforced concrete <unk> cast as the tower was weak at this point and had distorted 
 The <unk> , the curb segments and <unk> <unk> were given two coats of red lead paint 
 A new <unk> for the cap was made from a piece of oak 3 feet ( 910 mm ) long by 16 inches ( 410 mm ) diameter 
 A start was made on removing the old pointing on the brickwork and <unk> with <unk> mortar 
After the work @-@ in had finished , the boarding of the stone floor was completed and the mill thoroughly cleaned in preparation for an open day which was held in late autumn 
 The work done in 1981 cost £ 3 @,@ 250 
 <unk> received were £ 2 @,@ 000 from <unk> <unk> , £ 1 @,@ <unk> from the Historic Buildings Council and £ 130 from St <unk> Borough Council 
 Other donations and income received amounted to £ 70 
 The project received further coverage in local media , the Eastern Daily Press , and South Norfolk News 
The 1982 work @-@ ins took place from 24 July to 1 August and 21 August to 29 August 
 The work planned included the completion of the brickwork at the top of the tower , installation of the <unk> curb , a start on the construction of the new cap , installing machinery and making and fitting various doors and windows 
 The cap frame was constructed , incorporating two beams from the original cap frame that were fit to be reused 
 The cap frame was completed in autumn 1982 
 It had been constructed upside down and a mobile crane was used to turn it over and place the <unk> into position 
When the weather improved , work commenced outside 
 The cap circle was mostly constructed before the first work @-@ in commenced 
 The work @-@ ins took place over two separate weeks in July and August , with 35 people participating 
 During the first work @-@ in , the <unk> posts and <unk> were fitted 
 The oak cap ribs , which had been prefabricated <unk> were fitted and the <unk> was supported by scaffolding ready for final fitting 
 <unk> <unk> of oak were fitted and the <unk> was pulled into position using a <unk> 
 The cap frame was competed with the fitting of intermediate ribs and <unk> 
 The rear of the cap circle was also completed during this time 
Between the two work @-@ ins , the rear <unk> was completed and the fitting of <unk> to the cap frame completed 
 This enabled a start to be made on boarding the cap on the Monday of the second work @-@ in 
 The boards for the cap are ½ inch ( 13 mm ) thick and 9 inches ( 230 mm ) wide at the <unk> , <unk> towards the top 
 A new neck bearing was installed under the <unk> , not without difficulty and much <unk> before it would fit 
 When the boarding of the cap was completed , the cover strips were fitted over the joints 
 The <unk> was drawn into position using a rope and <unk> , and the <unk> steel reinforcing band <unk> into position , producing a <unk> structure 
 The striking rod was fitted through the <unk> and the axle for the <unk> fitted in position on top of the <unk> posts 
 At the top of the mill tower , the curb was prepared to accept the cap , and the cast iron curb track plates <unk> into position 
 <unk> of the brickwork of the tower continued , with nearly half of it completed at the end of the second work @-@ in 
After the work @-@ ins had ended , work continued on finishing the cap which was scheduled for lift @-@ on in October 
 The weather hampered the work initially , but the application of a modern <unk> paint , designed to withstand normal movement of the timber and yet remain <unk> , was completed in time for the lift @-@ on 
 A mini work @-@ in was held the weekend before the cap was lifted , with 17 people participating over the weekend 
 Final work was done to the cap and a new window was fitted to the stone floor of the mill 
 The <unk> was removed and the <unk> dismantled 
 The 5 @-@ ton cap was lifted into place by a mobile crane on 24 October 1983 , watched by a crowd of some 70 people 
 The fitting of the cap was <unk> with beer from <unk> <unk> , <unk> 
Four work @-@ ins were held during 1984 
 The first two were by <unk> from Eastern Electricity Board 
 <unk> <unk> was chosen at the project to benefit from the Young Person 's Development Project for that year 
 <unk> <unk> had previously benefited from the project , and its owners , the Suffolk Preservation Trust , had suggested that <unk> <unk> would be a good candidate for the scheme 
 Two separate parties spent a week each at the mill 
 A <unk> electricity supply was provided 
 An underground cable was laid with assistance from British Telecom who were <unk> a thrust <unk> which had been developed at their research facility at <unk> Heath 
 The thrust <unk> laid 25 yards ( 23 m ) of <unk> through which the <unk> cable was pulled into position 
 The mill was then supplied with lights and <unk> on each floor 
Other work undertaken by the <unk> involved repairing some <unk> damage to the foundation brickwork , digging a drainage trench around the mill and moving the auxiliary engine into position 
 A concrete path around the tower was trapping moisture , leading to rising <unk> 
 A French drain was constructed around the mill to remedy these problem 
 A 21 horsepower ( 16 kW ) <unk> & <unk> <unk> diesel engine had been purchased in 1981 and was fitted onto a permanent concrete base with the aid of a mobile crane 
 After fitting it was then painted 
 Some missing or broken parts were made or repaired as necessary 
Off @-@ site , the new brake wheel and <unk> were made 
 The original brake wheel was too rotten to repair , and showed evidence that it had been altered from the original one installed in 1819 
 The original brake wheel was 6 feet ( 1 @
@ 83 m ) diameter to allow the Common sails to run at their <unk> speed 
 When the mill was modernised in 1832 it was necessary to alter the gear ratios within the mill , as Patent sails run at a slower speed than Common sails 
 The great spur wheel was increased in diameter and the stone nuts reduced in diameter 
 The brake wheel was also rebuilt , with a cast iron segment ring fitted in place of the original <unk> , resulting in a wheel 7 feet 2 inches ( 2 @
@ 18 m ) in diameter 
 The opinion of professional <unk> was sought , and it was decided that a scaled @-@ up version of the original brake wheel would be made , but retaining the cast iron teeth segments 
 The remains of the original brake wheel were retained as an exhibit in the mill 
 The original iron segments were all broken , so a pattern was made and new segments were cast in heat @-@ treated malleable cast iron 
 When the brake wheel was completed it was dismantled and transported to the mill ready for <unk> 
The <unk> was made 
 Some of the small <unk> were replaced 
 The stocks were made from pitch pine and the <unk> from Douglas fir 
 Work at the mill over the winter included repairs to the brickwork and windows , with only one window still needing attention when the first work @-@ in began 
 New beech <unk> were fitted to the crown wheel , which was restored to its correct position on the upright shaft 
The stocks and sails were made during the two work @-@ ins held in July and August , a total of 41 people attending over the two weeks 
 A second @-@ hand stock had been bought in the 1920s and preserved at the mill , but upon examination it was found to be unfit for use 
 Thus two new stocks were required instead of one 
 Modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and <unk> grounds , leaving two options 
 Traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber , or <unk> stocks 
 Good quality pitch pine was not <unk> in the lengths required 
 Douglas fir was <unk> in such lengths but was discounted on strength and <unk> grounds 
 A Douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had <unk> after only seven years 
 Thus it was decided that <unk> stocks would be made 
The 52 feet ( 15 @
@ 85 m ) long stocks were made from Douglas fir 
 All timber had been pressure treated with <unk> and well <unk> 
 It was estimated that a <unk> stock would be up to 20 % stronger than a similar stock of solid timber 
 The timber used was 1 1 ⁄ 2 inches ( 38 mm ) thick and nine <unk> were required at the centre , where the stock passes through the poll end of the <unk> 
 <unk> attention was paid to where individual joints occurred between different pieces of timber 
 Both stocks were made during the work @-@ in , with one of them being trimmed and finished ready for use 
 The stocks were the first <unk> stocks made by amateurs 
The four sails were made 
 The originals being slightly different pairs 
 Those on the inner stock having bays of 3 feet ( 910 mm ) pitch and those on the outer stock having bays of 3 feet 2 inches ( 970 mm ) pitch 
 It was decided that the new sails would be identical , at the larger pitch 
 Four 27 feet ( 8 @
@ 23 m ) long <unk> were cut from a <unk> of pitch pine obtained from a demolished <unk> at Bury St <unk> 
 The <unk> are 6 inches ( 150 mm ) square at their inner end 
 <unk> bars and <unk> were made from modern pitch pine , selected for quality 
 The <unk> for the sail bars were cut 
 That at the heel of the sail being at 27 ° and that at the tip being 15 ° , decreasing by 1 ½ ° at each sail bar 
 Three of the four sails had been completed at the end of the work in 
The <unk> and associated <unk> was fitted to the mill 
 At the end of the second work @-@ in , the cap could be turned by means of the hand <unk> 
 The <unk> itself , with the <unk> painted red , white and blue was installed shortly afterwards 
 The <unk> arm brake wheel was assembled around the <unk> 
 It was found that the <unk> was eccentric on the upright shaft by ½ inch ( 13 mm ) 
 When this was corrected the brake wheel was within 1 / 16 <unk> of an inch ( less than 1 mm ) of true 
 The <unk> for the stocks were <unk> from a <unk> of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year 
 Other work included a new frame for one of the ground floor doors , cleaning and painting <unk> and further <unk> on the brickwork 
 The four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at the end of the second work @-@ in 
 The stock , with one sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the <unk> and when <unk> in position and the <unk> had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock 
 The process was repeated for the second pair of sails 
 The mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work @-@ in 
Restoration work in 1984 cost £ 2 @,@ 918 
 Grants received were £ 1 @,@ <unk> from English Heritage , £ 500 from St <unk> Borough Council , Other donations amounted to £ 52 
 <unk> from open days at the mill came to £ 151 
 A boost to the funds was £ 2 @,@ 000 from <unk> <unk> 
 This money had been allocated to allow the moving of a <unk> post mill buck to <unk> 
 In the end , the removal was not proceeded with , and Mr <unk> allowed the donation to remain with the <unk> Mill Preservation Trust 
 The project received further support in local media , including the East Anglian Daily Times , one of the work @-@ ins being featured on <unk> Television 's About <unk> programme 
The <unk> cap sits on top of the tower , giving the mill an overall height of 45 feet ( 13 @
@ 72 m ) to the <unk> 
 It houses the cast @-@ iron <unk> and 7 feet 2 inches ( 2 @
@ 18 m ) diameter wooden brake wheel internally 
 <unk> the four double Patent sails span 64 feet ( 19 @
@ 51 m ) 
 They are 9 feet ( 2 @
@ 74 m ) wide and can develop 30 horsepower ( 22 kW ) 
 The eight <unk> <unk> keeps the mill turned into wind 
The stone floor is where the two pairs of <unk> French Burr <unk> are located 
 The stones are 4 feet 4 inches ( 1 @
@ 32 m ) and 4 feet 7 inches ( 1 @
@ 40 m ) diameter 
 The wooden crown wheel is located towards the ceiling 
 This drives the <unk> hoist on the bin floor 
 Other machinery on this floor are an <unk> <unk> and a flour <unk> 
The ground floor of the mill is the meal floor 
 It is where the <unk> ground flour is delivered for <unk> up 
 The wooden great spur wheel , located at the bottom of the extended upright shaft and stone nuts are located on this floor 
 The great spur wheel has been converted from <unk> arm construction to <unk> arm construction 
 A third pair of 4 feet 6 inches ( 1 @
@ 37 m ) diameter French Burr <unk> is located on a <unk> frame , driven by the auxiliary engine via a fast and loose <unk> 
The series follows the adventures and <unk> of the title character and his various friends in the underwater city of <unk> <unk> 
 In this episode , <unk> reads a " bad word " off a <unk> behind the <unk> <unk> , but does not know what it means 
 Patrick explains to him that it is a " sentence <unk> " which is used " when you want to talk fancy 
 " The two start using it in every sentence they speak 
 However , when Mr

 The two cannot believe it and run to Mama <unk> to tell on him 
 Mama <unk> , who is <unk> by their use of the words , makes the three paint her house as punishment 
When <unk> goes around to the back of the <unk> <unk> to take out the trash , he reads some words written on a <unk> 
 <unk> asks Patrick what is it and Patrick says that the word is a " sentence <unk> " which is used " when you want to talk fancy 
 " The next day , <unk> walks into the <unk> <unk> and says the word to Patrick and then over the <unk> 
 The <unk> <unk> customers are <unk> by <unk> 's use of his " word " and leave 
 <unk> then informs Mr

" <unk> Mouth " was directed by Andrew <unk> , and was written by Walt <unk> , Paul <unk> , and <unk> Williams 
 <unk> and <unk> also served as storyboard directors , and Carson <unk> , William <unk> and Erik <unk> worked as storyboard artists 
 Series creator Stephen <unk> has described the episode plot as " a classic thing all kids go through 
 " Much of the storyline for the episode was inspired by the writers ' own experiences from childhood 
 The episode originally aired on <unk> in the United States on September 21 , 2001 
 The episode marks the introduction of Mr
 <unk> ' mother , Mama <unk> , who was voiced by former <unk> <unk> creative producer and current executive producer Paul <unk> 
The writing staff used their individual childhood experiences as inspirations to come up with much of the story lines for this episode 
 The idea for " <unk> Mouth " was inspired by creative director Derek <unk> 's experience " [ when ] I got in trouble for saying the f @-@ word in front of my mother 
 " <unk> said , " The scene where Patrick is running to Mr
 <unk> to <unk> , with <unk> chasing him , is pretty much how it happened in real life 
 " The end of the episode , where Mr
 <unk> uses more <unk> than <unk> and Patrick , was also inspired " by the fact that my [ <unk> 's ] mother has a sailor mouth herself 
Erik <unk> , a member of the <unk> <unk> crew , considers " <unk> Mouth " to be his favorite episode , mainly due to its random and satirical nature , saying " Sometimes <unk> just catches me off @-@ guard 
 " Nancy <unk> of About
com ranked the episode at number two for her list of the Top 10 <unk> <unk> Episodes 
 She said " ' <unk> Mouth ' just barely missed being in the number one slot 
 " <unk> praised the episode 's plot and called it " genius [ 


 ] because children can relate to the forbidden <unk> of using curse words , and adults can laugh at the parody of TV censorship 
 " In an interview with Paul <unk> , one of the episode 's writers , he told that " <unk> Mouth " is his second favorite <unk> episode 
According to a report titled Wolves in <unk> 's <unk> , which documents the increase in potentially violent , <unk> , and sexual content in children 's programming , the Parents Television Council , a <unk> media group , and fans believed the <unk> <unk> episode " <unk> Mouth " was an implicit attempt to promote and <unk> use of <unk> among children 
 The episode originally aired during the 2001 – 02 television season , ironically the season in which the PTC named <unk> <unk> among the best programs on cable television , but the report cited a repeat broadcast of the episode from 2005 to prove its point that it promoted use of <unk> among children 
 In a later report , several members of the PTC listed " <unk> Mouth " as an example of how levels of <unk> , sexual , and violent activity has increased in children 's television programming 
 <unk> , in response to the incident , said " It 's sad and a little desperate that they <unk> to literally putting <unk> language in the mouths of our characters to make a point 
 Has the FCC looked at this ? " Richard <unk> of the New York Daily News criticized the report for <unk> an episode of <unk> <unk> , " <unk> Mouth " , over its intent to <unk> <unk> implicitly 
Reflecting both the realist and liberal <unk> of international relations and the conception of national interests , a number of other important themes in Australian strategic culture are also obvious 
 Such themes include : an acceptance of the state as the key actor in international politics , the <unk> of notions of <unk> sovereignty , a belief in the enduring relevance and legitimacy of armed force as a <unk> of security , and the proposition that the status <unk> in international affairs should only be changed peacefully 
 Likewise , <unk> , collective security and defence self @-@ reliance have also been important themes 
 Change has been more evolutionary than revolutionary and these strategic <unk> have persisted throughout its history , being the product of Australian society 's democratic political tradition and <unk> @-@ Christian Anglo @-@ European heritage , as well its associated values , beliefs and economic , political and religious ideology 
 These <unk> are also reflective of its unique security dilemma as a largely European island on the edge of the Asia @-@ Pacific , and the <unk> circumstances of a middle power physically removed from the centres of world power 
 To be sure , during threats to the core Australia has often found itself defending the periphery and perhaps as a result , it has frequently become involved in foreign wars 
 Throughout these conflicts Australian soldiers — known colloquially as <unk> — have often been noted , somewhat <unk> , for both their fighting abilities and their humanitarian qualities 
From 1788 until 1870 the defence of the Australian colonies was mostly provided by British Army regular forces 
 Originally Marines protected the early settlements at Sydney Cove and Norfolk Island , however they were relieved of these duties in 1790 by a British Army unit specifically recruited for colonial service , known as the New South Wales Corps 
 The New South Wales Corps subsequently was involved in putting down a rebellion of Irish convicts at Castle Hill in 1804 
 Soon however shortcomings in the corps convinced the War Office of the need for a more reliable garrison in New South Wales and Van <unk> 's Land 
 Chief of these shortcomings was the Rum Rebellion , a coup mounted by its officers in 1808 
 As a result , in January 1810 the 73rd ( <unk> ) Regiment of Foot arrived in Australia 
 By 1870 , 25 British infantry regiments had served in Australia , as had a small number of artillery and engineer units 
The reactions of the native Aboriginal inhabitants to the sudden arrival of British settlers in Australia were varied , but were inevitably hostile when the settler 's presence led to competition over resources , and to the occupation of the indigenous inhabitants ' lands 
 European diseases decimated Aboriginal populations , and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources sometimes led to starvation 
 By and large neither the British nor the <unk> approached the conflict in an organised sense and conflict occurred between groups of settlers and individual tribes rather than systematic warfare 
 At times , however , the frontier wars did see the involvement of British soldiers and later mounted police units 
 Not all Aboriginal groups resisted white encroachment on their lands , while many <unk> served in mounted police units and were involved in attacks on other tribes 
Fighting between <unk> and Europeans was localised as the <unk> did not form <unk> capable of sustained resistance 
 As a result , there was not a single war , but rather a series of violent engagements and massacres across the continent 
 <unk> or disorganised however , a pattern of frontier warfare emerged with Aboriginal resistance beginning in the 18th century and continuing into the early 20th century 
 This warfare <unk> the popular and at times academic " myth " of peaceful settlement in Australia 
 Faced with Aboriginal resistance settlers often reacted with violence , resulting in a number of indiscriminate massacres 
 Among the most famous is the Battle of <unk> in Western Australia in 1834 
 Such incidents were not officially sanctioned however , and after the <unk> Creek massacre in New South Wales in 1838 seven Europeans were hanged for their part in the killings 
 However , in Tasmania the so @-@ called Black War was fought between 1828 and 1832 , and aimed at driving most of the island 's native inhabitants onto a number of isolated peninsulas 
 Although it began in failure for the British , it ultimately resulted in considerable casualties amongst the native population 
It may be inaccurate though to depict the conflict as one sided and mainly <unk> by Europeans on <unk> 
 Although many more <unk> died than British , this may have had more to do with the technological and logistic advantages enjoyed by the Europeans 
 Aboriginal tactics varied , but were mainly based on pre @-@ existing hunting and fighting practices — using <unk> , clubs and other primitive weapons 
 Unlike the indigenous peoples of New Zealand and North America , on the main <unk> failed to adapt to meet the challenge of the Europeans 
 Although there were some instances of individuals and groups acquiring and using firearms , this was not widespread 
 The <unk> were never a serious military threat to European settlers , regardless of how much the settlers may have feared them 
 On occasions large groups of <unk> attacked the settlers in open terrain and a conventional battle ensued , during which the <unk> would attempt to use superior numbers to their advantage 
 This could sometimes be effective , with reports of them advancing in crescent formation in an attempt to outflank and surround their opponents , waiting out the first volley of shots and then hurling their <unk> while the settlers <unk> 
 However , such open warfare usually proved more costly for the <unk> than the Europeans 
Central to the success of the Europeans was the use of firearms 
 However , the advantages afforded by firearms have often been <unk> 
 Prior to the late 19th century , firearms were often <unk> muzzle @-@ loading , smooth @-@ bore , single shot <unk> with flint @-@ lock mechanisms 
 Such weapons produced a low rate of fire , while suffering from a high rate of failure and were only accurate within 50 metres ( 160 ft ) 
 These deficiencies may have initially given the <unk> an advantage , allowing them to move in close and engage with <unk> or clubs 
 Yet by 1850 significant advances in firearms gave the Europeans a distinct advantage , with the six @-@ shot <unk> revolver , the <unk> single shot breech @-@ loading rifle and later the <unk> @-@ Henry rifle , as well as rapid @-@ fire rifles such as the Winchester rifle , becoming available 
 These weapons , when used on open ground and combined with the superior mobility provided by horses to surround and engage groups of <unk> , often proved successful 
 The Europeans also had to adapt their tactics to fight their fast @-@ moving , often hidden enemies 
 Tactics employed included night @-@ time surprise attacks , and positioning forces to drive the natives off cliffs or force them to retreat into rivers while attacking from both banks 
The conflict lasted for over 150 years and followed the pattern of British settlement in Australia 
 Beginning in New South Wales with the arrival of the first Europeans in May 1788 , it continued in Sydney and its surrounds until the 1820s 
 As the frontier moved west so did the conflict , pushing into outback New South Wales in the 1840s 
 In Tasmania , fighting can be traced from 1804 to the 1830s , while in Victoria and the southern parts of South Australia , the majority of the violence occurred during the 1830s and 1840s 
 The south @-@ west of Western Australia experienced warfare from 1829 to 1850 
 The war in Queensland began in the area around Brisbane in the 1840s and continued until 1860 , moving to central Queensland in the 1850s and 1860s , and then to northern Queensland from the 1860s to 1900 
 In Western Australia , the violence moved north with European settlement , reaching the <unk> region by 1880 , with violent clashes continuing until the 1920s 
 In the Northern Territory conflict lasted even later still , especially in central Australia , continuing from the 1880s to the 1930s 
 One estimate of casualties places European deaths at 2 @,@ 500 , while at least 20 @,@ 000 <unk> are believed to have perished 
 Far more devastating though was the effect of disease which significantly reduced the Aboriginal population by the beginning of the 20th century ; a fact which may also have limited their ability to resist 
In late 1863 , the New Zealand government requested troops to assist in the invasion of the <unk> province against the Māori 
 <unk> settlement on confiscated land , more than 2 @,@ 500 Australians ( over half of whom were from Victoria ) were recruited to form four <unk> Regiments 
 Other Australians became scouts in the Company of Forest Rangers 
 Despite experiencing <unk> conditions the Australians were not heavily involved in battle , and were primarily used for patrolling and garrison duties 
 Australians were involved in actions at <unk> , <unk> East , <unk> Hill , <unk> and Te <unk> 
 <unk> than 20 were believed to have been killed in action 
 The conflict was over by 1864 , and the <unk> Regiments disbanded in 1867 
 However , many of the soldiers who had chosen to claim farmland at the cessation of hostilities had drifted to the towns and cities by the end of the decade , while many others had returned to Australia 
From 1870 until 1901 , each of the six colonial governments was responsible for their own defence 
 The colonies had gained responsible government between 1855 and 1890 , and while the Colonial Office in London retained control of some affairs , the Governor of the each colony was required to raise their own colonial militia 
 To do this , they were granted the authority from the British crown to raise military and naval forces 
 Initially these were militias in support of British regulars , but when military support for the colonies ended in 1870 , the colonies assumed their own defence responsibilities 
 The colonial military forces included unpaid volunteer militia , paid citizen soldiers , and a small permanent component 
 They were mainly infantry , cavalry and mounted infantry , and were neither housed in barracks nor subject to full military discipline 
 Even after significant reforms in the 1870s — including the expansion of the permanent forces to include engineer and artillery units — they remained too small and <unk> to be considered armies in the modern sense 
 By 1885 , the forces numbered 21 @,@ 000 men 
 Although they could not be compelled to serve overseas many volunteers subsequently did see action in a number conflicts of the British Empire during the 19th century , with the colonies raising <unk> to serve in Sudan , South Africa and China 
Despite a reputation of colonial <unk> , many of the locally raised units were highly organised , disciplined , professional , and well trained 
 During this period , defences in Australia mainly revolved around static defence by combined infantry and artillery , based on garrisoned coastal forts 
 However , by the 1890s , improved railway communications between the mainland eastern colonies led Major General James Edwards — who had recently completed a survey of colonial military forces — to the belief that the colonies could be defended by the rapid <unk> of brigades of infantry 
 As a consequence he called for a <unk> of defences , and defensive agreements to be made between the colonies 
 Edwards argued for the colonial forces to be <unk> and for professional units — obliged to serve anywhere in the South Pacific — to replace the volunteer forces 
 These views found support in the influential New South Wales Commandant , Major General Edward Hutton , however suspicions held by the smaller colonies towards New South Wales and Victoria <unk> the proposal 
 These reforms remaining unresolved however , and defence issues were generally given little attention in the debate on the political federation of the colonies 
With the exception of Western Australia , the colonies also operated their own navies 
 In 1856 , Victoria received its own naval vessel , <unk> Victoria , and its deployment to New Zealand in 1860 during the First <unk> War marked the first occasion that an Australian warship had been deployed overseas 
 The colonial navies were expanded greatly in the mid @-@ 1880s and consisted of a number of gunboats and torpedo @-@ boats for the defence of harbours and rivers , as well as naval brigades to man vessels and forts 
 Victoria became the most powerful of all the colonial navies , with the ironclad <unk> Cerberus in service from 1870 , as well as the steam @-@ sail warship HMS Nelson on loan from the Royal Navy , three small gunboats and five torpedo @-@ boats 
 New South Wales formed a Naval Brigade in 1863 and by the start of the 20th century had two small torpedo @-@ boats and a <unk> 
 The Queensland Maritime Defence Force was established in 1885 , while South Australia operated a single ship , HMCS Protector 
 Tasmania had also a small Torpedo Corps , while Western Australia 's only naval defences included the Fremantle Naval Artillery 
 Naval personnel from New South Wales and Victoria took part in the suppression of the <unk> Rebellion in China in 1900 , while HMCS Protector was sent by South Australia but saw no action 
 The separate colonies maintained control over their military and naval forces until Federation in 1901 , when they were amalgamated and placed under the control of the new Commonwealth of Australia 
During the early years of the 1880s , an Egyptian regime in the Sudan , backed by the British , came under threat from rebellion under the leadership of native Muhammad Ahmad ( or Ahmed ) , known as Mahdi to his followers 
 In 1883 , as part of the <unk> War , the Egyptians sent an army to deal with the revolt , but they were defeated and faced a difficult campaign of <unk> their forces 
 The British instructed the Egyptians to abandon the Sudan , and sent General Charles Gordon to co @-@ <unk> the evacuation , but he was killed in January 1885 
 When news of his death arrived in New South Wales in February 1885 , the government offered to send forces and meet the contingent 's expenses 
 The New South Wales <unk> consisted of an infantry battalion of 522 men and 24 officers , and an artillery battery of 212 men and sailed from Sydney on 3 March 1885 
The contingent arrived in <unk> on 29 March and were attached to a brigade that consisted of Scots , <unk> and <unk> Guards 
 They subsequently marched for <unk> in a large " square " formation made up of 10 @,@ 000 men 
 Reaching the village , they burned <unk> and returned to <unk> : three Australians were wounded in minor fighting 
 Most of the contingent was then sent to work on a railway line that was being laid across the desert towards <unk> , on the Nile 
 The Australians were then assigned to guard duties , but soon a camel corps was raised and 50 men volunteered 
 They <unk> on a reconnaissance to <unk> on 6 May and were heavily involved in a <unk> during which more than 100 Arabs were killed or captured 
 On 15 May , they made one last sortie to bury the dead from the fighting of the previous March 
 Meanwhile , the artillery were posted at <unk> and drilled for a month , but they soon rejoined the camp at <unk> 
British encroachment into areas of South Africa already settled by the <unk> <unk> and the competition for resources and land that developed between them as a result , led to the Second Boer War in 1899 
 Pre @-@ <unk> the deployment of British forces , the <unk> <unk> of the Orange Free State and the <unk> Republic under President Paul <unk> declared war on 11 October 1899 , striking deep into the British territories of Natal and the Cape Colony 
 After the outbreak of war , plans for the dispatch of a combined Australian force were subsequently set aside by the British War Office and each of the six colonial governments sent separate <unk> to serve with British formations , with two squadrons each of 125 men from New South Wales and Victoria , and one each from the other colonies 
 The first troops arrived three weeks later , with the New South Wales <unk> — who had been training in England before the war , <unk> diverted to South Africa 
 On 22 November , the <unk> came under fire for the first time near <unk> , and they subsequently forced their attackers to withdraw after inflicting significant casualties on them 
Following a series of minor victories , the British suffered a major setback during Black Week between 10 – 17 December 1899 , although no Australian units were involved 
 The first <unk> of infantry from Victoria , South Australia , Western Australia , and Tasmania arrived in Cape Town on 26 November and were designated the Australian Regiment under the command of Colonel John Charles <unk> 
 With a need for increased mobility , they were soon converted into mounted infantry 
 Further units from Queensland and New South Wales arrived in December and were soon committed to the front 
 The first casualties occurred soon after at <unk> on 1 January 1900 , after 250 Queensland Mounted Infantry and a column of Canadians , British and artillery attacked a Boer <unk> at <unk> 
 <unk> David <unk> and Victor Jones were killed when their patrol clashed with the Boer forward <unk> 
 Regardless , the <unk> were surprised and during two hours of heavy fighting , more than 50 were killed and another 40 taken prisoner 
 Five hundred <unk> and the New South Wales <unk> subsequently took part in the Siege of <unk> in February 1900 
Despite serious set @-@ backs at <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> in January — and with <unk> still under siege — the British mounted a five division counter @-@ invasion of the Orange Free State in February 
 The attacking force included a division of cavalry commanded by Lieutenant General John French with the New South Wales <unk> , Queensland Mounted Infantry and New South Wales Army Medical Corps attached 
 First , <unk> was relieved following the battles of <unk> River and <unk> , and the retreating <unk> defeated at <unk> , with the New South Wales Mounted Rifles locating the Boer general , <unk> <unk> 
 The British entered <unk> on 13 March 1900 , while <unk> was relieved 
 Disease began to take its toll and scores of men died 
 Still the advance continued , with the drive to <unk> in May including more than 3 @,@ 000 Australians 
 Johannesburg fell on 30 May , and the <unk> withdrew from <unk> on 3 June 
 The New South Wales Mounted Rifles and Western Australians saw action again at Diamond Hill on 12 June 
 <unk> was relieved on 17 May 
Following the defeat of the <unk> republics still the <unk> held out , forming small commando units and conducting a campaign of guerrilla warfare to disrupt British troop movements and lines of supply 
 This new phase of resistance led to further recruiting in the Australian colonies and the raising of the <unk> 's <unk> , with these soldiers usually being volunteers with horse @-@ riding and shooting skills , but little military experience 
 After Federation in 1901 , eight Australian Commonwealth Horse battalions of the newly created Australian Army were also sent to South Africa , although they saw little fighting before the war ended 
 Some Australians later joined local South African irregular units , instead of returning home after discharge 
 These soldiers were part of the British Army , and were subject to British military discipline 
 Such units included the <unk> <unk> which gained notoriety as the unit in which Harry " <unk> " <unk> and Peter <unk> served in before their court martial and execution for war crimes 
With the guerrillas requiring supplies , <unk> de la Rey lead a force of 3 @,@ 000 <unk> against <unk> , on the <unk> River in Western <unk> 
 The post held a large quantity of stores and was defended by 300 Australians and 200 <unk> 
 The attack began on 4 August 1900 with heavy shelling causing 32 casualties 
 During the night the defenders dug in , enduring shelling and rifle fire 
 A relief force was stopped by the <unk> , while a second column turned back believing that the post had already been relieved 
 The siege lasted 11 days , during which more than 1 @,@ 800 shells were fired into the post 
 After calls to surrender were ignored by the defenders , and not prepared to risk a frontal attack , the <unk> eventually retired 
 The Siege of <unk> River was one of the major achievements of the Australians during the war , with the post finally relieved on 16 August 
In response the British adopted counter @-@ insurgency tactics , including a <unk> earth policy involving the burning of houses and crops , the establishment of concentration camps for Boer women and children , and a system of <unk> and field obstacles to limit Boer mobility and to protect railway communications 
 Such measures required considerable expenditure , and caused much bitterness towards the British , however they soon yielded results 
 By mid @-@ 1901 , the bulk of the fighting was over , and British mounted units would ride at night to attack Boer <unk> or <unk> , overwhelming them with superior numbers 
 <unk> of warfare in last months of 1901 , the New South Wales Mounted Rifles travelled 1 @,@ <unk> miles ( 2 @,@ <unk> km ) and were involved in 13 <unk> , killing 27 <unk> , wounding 15 , and capturing 196 for the loss of five dead and 19 wounded 
 Other notable Australian actions included <unk> , Pink Hill , <unk> and <unk> 
Australians were not always successful however , suffering a number of heavy losses late in the war 
 On 12 June 1901 , the 5th Victorian Mounted Rifles lost 19 killed and 42 wounded at <unk> , near <unk> after poor security allowed a force of 150 <unk> to surprise them 
 On 30 October 1901 , <unk> of the Scottish Horse Regiment also suffered heavy casualties at Gun Hill , although 60 <unk> were also killed in the engagement 
 Meanwhile , at <unk> on 4 January 1902 , the 5th Queensland Imperial <unk> lost 13 killed and 17 wounded 
 Ultimately the <unk> were defeated , and the war ended on 31 May 1902 
 In all 16 @,@ 175 Australians served in South Africa , and perhaps another 10 @,@ 000 enlisted as individuals in Imperial units ; casualties included 251 killed in action , 267 died of disease and 43 missing in action , while a further 735 were wounded 
 Six Australians were awarded the Victoria Cross 
The <unk> Rebellion in China began in 1900 , and a number of western nations — including many European powers , the United States , and Japan — soon sent forces as part of the China Field Force to protect their interests 
 In June , the British government sought permission from the Australian colonies to dispatch ships from the Australian Squadron to China 
 The colonies also offered to assist further , but as most of their troops were still engaged in South Africa , they had to rely on naval forces for manpower 
 The force dispatched was a modest one , with Britain accepting 200 men from Victoria , 260 from New South Wales and the South Australian ship HMCS Protector , under the command of Captain William <unk> 
 Most of these forces were made up of naval brigade <unk> , who had been trained in both ship handling and <unk> to fulfil their coastal defence role 
 Amongst the naval contingent from New South Wales were 200 naval officers and sailors and 50 permanent soldiers headquartered at Victoria Barracks , Sydney who originally enlisted for the Second Boer War 
 The soldiers were keen to go to China but refused to be enlisted as sailors , while the New South Wales Naval Brigade objected to having soldiers in their ranks 
 The Army and Navy compromised and titled the contingent the <unk> Marine Light Infantry 
The <unk> from New South Wales and Victoria sailed for China on 8 August 1900 
 Arriving in <unk> , the Australians provided 300 men to an 8 @,@ 000 @-@ strong multinational force tasked with capturing the Chinese forts at <unk> Tang , which dominated a key railway 
 They arrived too late to take part in the battle , but were involved in the attack on the fortress at <unk> @-@ <unk> Fu , where the Chinese government was believed to have found <unk> after <unk> was captured by western forces 
 The <unk> joined a force of 7 @,@ 500 men on a ten @-@ day march to the fort , once again only to find that it had already surrendered 
 The <unk> then garrisoned <unk> and the New South Wales contingent undertook garrison duties in <unk> 
 HMCS Protector was mostly used for survey , transport , and <unk> duties in the Gulf of <unk> , before departing in November 
 The naval brigades remained during the winter , <unk> performing policing and guard duties , as well as working as <unk> and fire @-@ fighters 
 They left China in March 1901 , having played only a minor role in a few offensives and punitive expeditions and in the restoration of civil order 
 Six Australians died from sickness and injury , but none were killed as a result of enemy action 
The Australian Commonwealth Military Forces came into being on 1 March 1901 and all the colonial forces — including those still in South Africa — became part of the new force 
 28 @,@ <unk> colonial soldiers , including 1 @,@ 457 professional soldiers , 18 @,@ 603 paid militia and 8 @,@ <unk> unpaid volunteers , were subsequently transferred 
 The individual units continued to be administered under the various colonial Acts until the Defence Act 1903 brought all the units under one piece of legislation 
 This Act also prevented the raising of standing infantry units and specified that militia forces could not be used in industrial disputes or serve outside Australia 
 However , the majority of soldiers remained in militia units , known as the Citizen Military Forces ( <unk> ) 
 Major General Sir Edward Hutton — a former commander of the New South Wales Military Forces — subsequently became the first commander of the Commonwealth Military Forces on 26 December and set to work <unk> an integrated structure for the new army 
 In 1911 , following a report by Lord <unk> the Royal Military College , <unk> was established , as was a system of universal National Service 
Prior to federation each self @-@ governing colony had operated its own naval force 
 These navies were small and lacked blue water capabilities , forcing the separate colonies to <unk> the cost of a British naval squadron in their waters for decades 
 The colonies maintained control over their respective navies until 1 March 1901 , when the Commonwealth Naval Force was created 
 This new force also lacked blue water capable ships , and ultimately did not lead to a change in Australian naval policy 
 In 1907 Prime Minister Alfred Deakin and <unk> , while attending the Imperial Conference in London , sought the British Government 's agreement to end the subsidy system and develop an Australian navy 
 The Admiralty rejected and resented the challenge , but suggested <unk> that a small fleet of destroyers and submarines would be sufficient 
 Deakin was unimpressed , and in 1908 invited the American Great White Fleet to visit Australia 
 This visit fired public enthusiasm for a modern navy and in part led to the order of two 700 @-@ ton River @-@ class destroyers 
 The surge in German naval construction prompted the Admiralty to change their position however and the Royal Australian Navy was subsequently formed in 1911 , absorbing the Commonwealth Naval Force 
 On 4 October 1913 , the new fleet steamed through Sydney Heads , consisting of the battlecruiser <unk> Australia , three light cruisers , and three destroyers , while several other ships were still under construction 
 And as a consequence the navy entered the First World War as a formidable force 
When Britain declared war on Germany at the start of the First World War , the Australian government rapidly followed suit , with Prime Minister Joseph Cook declaring on 5 August 1914 that " 


 when the Empire is at war , so also is Australia " and reflecting the sentiment of many Australians that any declaration of war by Britain automatically included Australia 
 This was itself in part due to the large number of British @-@ born citizens and first generation Anglo @-@ Australians that made up the Australian population at the time 
 Indeed , by the end of the war almost 20 % of those who served in the Australian forces had been born in Britain 
As the existing militia forces were unable to serve overseas under the provisions of the Defence Act 1903 , an all @-@ volunteer expeditionary force known as the Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) was formed and recruitment began on 10 August 1914 
 The government pledged 20 @,@ 000 men , organised as one infantry division and one light horse brigade plus supporting units 
 <unk> and organisation was primarily regionally based and was undertaken under <unk> plans drawn up in 1912 
 The first commander was Major General William Bridges , who also assumed command of the 1st Division 
 Throughout the course of the conflict Australian efforts were predominantly focused upon the ground war , although small air and naval forces were also committed 
Following the outbreak of war Australian forces moved quickly to reduce the threat to shipping posed by the proximity of Germany 's Pacific colonies 
 The Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force ( <unk> & <unk> ) , a 2000 @-@ man volunteer force — separate from the AIF — and consisting of an infantry battalion plus 500 naval <unk> and ex @-@ sailors , was rapidly formed under the command of William Holmes 
 The objectives of the force were the wireless stations on <unk> , and those at Yap in the Caroline Islands , and at Rabaul in German New Guinea 
 The force reached Rabaul on 11 September 1914 and occupied it the next day , encountering only brief resistance from the German and native defenders during fighting at <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 German New Guinea surrendered on 17 September 1914 
 Australian losses were light , including six killed during the fighting , but were compounded by the mysterious loss offshore of the submarine <unk> with all 35 men aboard 
After the withdrawal from Gallipoli the Australians returned to Egypt and the AIF underwent a major expansion 
 In 1916 the infantry began to move to France while the cavalry units remained in the Middle East to fight the Turks 
 Australian troops of the Anzac Mounted Division and the Australian Mounted Division saw action in all the major battles of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign , playing a pivotal role in fighting the Turkish troops that were threatening British control of Egypt 
 The Australian 's first saw combat during the <unk> uprising in the <unk> Desert and the Nile Valley , during which the combined British forces successfully put down the primitive pro @-@ Turkish Islamic sect with heavy casualties 
 The Anzac Mounted Division subsequently saw considerable action in the Battle of Romani against the Turkish between 3 – 5 August 1916 , with the Turks eventually pushed back 
 Following this victory the British forces went on the offensive in the Sinai , although the pace of the advance was governed by the speed by which the railway and water pipeline could be constructed from the Suez Canal 
 Rafa was captured on 9 January 1917 , while the last of the small Turkish garrisons in the Sinai were eliminated in February 
The advance entered Palestine and an initial , unsuccessful attempt was made to capture Gaza on 26 March 1917 , while a second and equally unsuccessful attempt was launched on 19 April 
 A third assault occurred between 31 October and 7 November and this time both the Anzac Mounted Division and the Australian Mounted Division took part 
 The battle was a complete success for the British , over @-@ running the Gaza @-@ Beersheba line and capturing 12 @,@ 000 Turkish soldiers 
 The critical moment was the capture of Beersheba on the first day , after the Australian 4th Light Horse Brigade charged more than 4 miles ( 6 @
@ 4 km ) 
 The Turkish trenches were overrun , with the Australians capturing the wells at <unk> and securing the valuable water they contained along with over 700 prisoners for the loss of 31 killed and 36 wounded 
 Later , Australian troops assisted in pushing the Turkish forces out of Palestine and took part in actions at <unk> Ridge , Jerusalem and the <unk> 
 The Turkish government surrendered on 30 October 1918 
 Units of the Light Horse were subsequently used to help put down a nationalist revolt in Egypt in 1919 and did so with efficiency and brutality , although they suffered a number of fatalities in the process 
Five infantry divisions of the AIF saw action in France and Belgium , leaving Egypt in March 1916 
 I Anzac Corps subsequently took up positions in a quiet sector south of <unk> on 7 April 1916 and for the next two and a half years the AIF participated in most of the major battles on the Western Front , earning a formidable reputation 
 Although spared from the disastrous first day of the Battle of the Somme , within weeks four Australian divisions had been committed 
 The 5th Division , positioned on the left flank , was the first in action during the Battle of <unk> on 19 July 1916 , suffering 5 @,@ 533 casualties in a single day 
 The 1st Division entered the line on 23 July , assaulting <unk> , and by the time that they were relieved by the 2nd Division on 27 July , they had suffered 5 @,@ 286 casualties 
 Mouquet Farm was attacked in August , with casualties totalling 6 @,@ 300 men 
 By the time the AIF was withdrawn from the Somme to re @-@ organise , they had suffered 23 @,@ 000 casualties in just 45 days 
In March 1917 , the 2nd and 5th Divisions pursued the Germans back to the Hindenburg Line , capturing the town of <unk> 
 On 11 April , the 4th Division assaulted the Hindenburg Line in the disastrous First Battle of <unk> , losing over 3 @,@ 000 casualties and 1 @,@ 170 captured 
 On 15 April , the 1st and 2nd Divisions were counter @-@ attacked near <unk> and were forced to abandon the town , before <unk> it again 
 The 2nd Division then took part in the Second Battle of <unk> , beginning on 3 May , and succeeded in taking sections of the Hindenburg Line and holding them until relieved by the 1st Division 
 Finally , on 7 May the 5th Division relieved the 1st , remaining in the line until the battle ended in mid @-@ May 
 Combined these efforts cost 7 @,@ <unk> Australian casualties 
On 7 June 1917 , the II Anzac Corps — along with two British corps — launched an operation in Flanders to eliminate a salient south of Ypres 
 The attack commenced with the detonation of a million pounds ( 454 @,@ 545 kg ) of explosives that had been placed underneath the <unk> ridge , destroying the German trenches 
 The advance was virtually unopposed , and despite strong German counterattacks the next day , it succeeded 
 Australian casualties during the Battle of <unk> included nearly 6 @,@ 800 men 
 I Anzac Corps then took part in the Third Battle of Ypres in Belgium as part of the campaign to capture the <unk> Plateau , between September and November 1917 
 Individual actions took place at <unk> Road , <unk> Wood , <unk> , <unk> and Passchendaele and over the course of eight weeks fighting the Australians suffered 38 @,@ 000 casualties 
On 21 March 1918 the German Army launched its Spring Offensive in a last @-@ <unk> effort to win the war , <unk> sixty @-@ three divisions over a 70 miles ( 110 km ) front 
 As the Allies fell back the 3rd and 4th Divisions were rushed south to Amiens on the Somme 
 The offensive lasted for the next five months and all five AIF divisions in France were engaged in the attempt to stem the tide 
 By late May the Germans had pushed to within 50 miles ( 80 km ) of Paris 
 During this time the Australians fought at <unk> , <unk> , <unk> @-@ <unk> , <unk> Wood , <unk> , and Hamel 
 At Hamel the commander of the Australian Corps , Lieutenant General John Monash , successfully used combined arms — including aircraft , artillery and armour — in an attack for the first time 
The German offensive ground to a halt in mid @-@ July and a brief lull followed , during which the Australians undertook a series of raids , known as <unk> <unk> 
 The Allies soon launched their own offensive — the Hundred Days Offensive — ultimately ending the war 
 Beginning on 8 August 1918 the offensive included four Australian divisions striking at Amiens 
 Using the combined arms techniques developed earlier at Hamel , significant gains were made on what became known as the " Black Day " of the German Army 
 The offensive continued for four months , and during Second Battle of the Somme the Australian Corps fought actions at <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and Mont St Quentin , before their final engagement of the war on 5 October 1918 at <unk> 
 The AIF was subsequently out of the line when the armistice was declared on 11 November 1918 
In all <unk> @,@ <unk> Australians enlisted in the AIF during the war and 333 @,@ 000 served overseas 
 61 @,@ 508 were killed and another 155 @,@ 000 were wounded ( a total casualty rate of 65 % ) 
 The financial cost to the Australian government was calculated at £ <unk> @,@ <unk> @,@ <unk> 
 Two <unk> on conscription for overseas service had been defeated during the war , preserving the volunteer status of the Australian force , but stretching the reserves of manpower available , particularly towards the end of the fighting 
 Consequently , Australia remained one of only two armies on either side not to resort to conscription during the war 
The Russian Civil War began after the Russian provisional government collapsed and the <unk> party assumed power in October 1917 
 Following the end of the First World War , the western powers — including Britain — intervened , giving half @-@ hearted support to the pro @-@ <unk> , anti @-@ <unk> White Russian forces 
 Although the Australian government refused to commit forces , many Australians serving with the British Army became involved in the fighting 
 A small number served as advisors to White Russian units with the North Russian Expeditionary Force ( <unk> ) 
 <unk> repatriation in England , about 150 Australians subsequently enlisted in the British North Russia Relief Force ( <unk> ) , where they were involved in a number of sharp battles and several were killed 
While a celebrated cause for the Australian left — particularly the Communist Party of Australia and the trade union movement — the war failed to spark particular public interest and the government maintained its neutrality 
 Australian opposition to the Republican cause was <unk> by <unk> <unk> on an anti @-@ communist basis , rather than a pro @-@ Nationalist basis 
 <unk> , although individual right wing Australians may have served with the Nationalist rebels , they received no public support 
 Service in a foreign armed force was illegal at the time , however as the government received no reports of Australians travelling to Spain to enlist , no action was taken 
 Consequently , returned veterans were neither recognised by the government or the <unk> and Services League of Australia ( <unk> ) 
 Although the number of Australian volunteers was relatively small compared to those from other countries , at least 14 were killed 
Australia entered the Second World War on 3 September 1939 
 At the time of the declaration of war against Germany the Australian military was small and <unk> for war 
 <unk> for a Second Australian Imperial Force ( 2nd AIF ) began in mid @-@ September 
 While there was no rush of volunteers like the First World War , a high proportion of Australian men of military age had enlisted by mid @-@ 1940 
 Four infantry divisions were formed during 1939 and 1940 , three of which were dispatched to the Middle East 
 The RAAF 's resources were initially mainly devoted to training airmen for service with the Commonwealth air forces through the Empire Air Training Scheme ( <unk> ) , through which almost 28 @,@ 000 Australians were trained during the war 
The Australian military 's first major engagements of the war were against Italian forces in the Mediterranean and North Africa 
 During 1940 the light cruiser <unk> Sydney and five elderly destroyers ( dubbed the " <unk> Iron Flotilla " by Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels — a title proudly accepted by the ships ) took part in a series of operations as part of the British Mediterranean Fleet , and sank several Italian warships 
 The Army first saw action in January 1941 , when the 6th Division formed part of the Commonwealth forces during Operation <unk> 
 The division assaulted and captured <unk> on 5 January and <unk> on 22 January , with tens of thousands of Italian troops surrendering at both towns 
 The 6th Division took part in the pursuit of the Italian Army and captured <unk> on 4 February 
 In late February it was withdrawn for service in Greece , and was replaced by the 9th Division 
The Australian forces in the Mediterranean endured a number of campaigns during 1941 
 During April , the 6th Division , other elements of I Corps and several Australian warships formed part of the Allied force which unsuccessfully attempted to defend Greece from German invasion during the Battle of Greece 
 At the end of this campaign , the 6th Division was evacuated to Egypt and Crete 
 The force at Crete subsequently fought in the Battle of Crete during May , which also ended in defeat for the Allies 
 Over 5 @,@ 000 Australians were captured in these campaigns , and the 6th Division required a long period of rebuilding before it was again ready for combat 
 The Germans and Italians also went on the offensive in North Africa at the end of March and drove the Commonwealth force there back to near the border with Egypt 
 The 9th Division and a brigade of the 7th Division were besieged at <unk> ; successfully defending the key port town until they were replaced by British units in October 
 During June , the main body of the 7th Division , a brigade of the 6th Division and the I Corps headquarters took part in the Syria @-@ Lebanon Campaign against the <unk> French 
 Resistance was stronger than expected ; Australians were involved in most of the fighting and sustained most of the casualties before the French <unk> in early July 
The RAAF 's role in the strategic air offensive in Europe formed Australia 's main contribution to the defeat of Germany 
 Approximately 13 @,@ 000 Australian airmen served in dozens of British and five Australian squadrons in RAF <unk> Command between 1940 and the end of the war 
 Australians took part in all of <unk> Command 's major offensives and suffered heavy losses during raids on German cities and targets in France 
 Australian aircrew in <unk> Command had one of the highest casualty rates of any part of the Australian military during the Second World War and sustained almost 20 percent of all Australian deaths in combat ; 3 @,@ 486 were killed and hundreds more were taken prisoner 
 Australian airmen in light bomber and fighter squadrons also participated in the liberation of Western Europe during 1944 and 1945 and two RAAF maritime patrol squadrons served in the Battle of the Atlantic 
From the 1920s Australia 's defence thinking was dominated by British Imperial defence policy , which was embodied by the " Singapore strategy " 
 This strategy involved the construction and defence of a major naval base at Singapore from which a large British fleet would respond to Japanese aggression in the region 
 To this end , a high proportion of Australian forces in Asia were concentrated in Malaya during 1940 and 1941 as the threat from Japan increased 
 However , as a result of the emphasis on co @-@ operation with Britain , relatively few Australian military units had been retained in Australia and the Asia @-@ Pacific region 
 Measures were taken to improve Australia 's defences as war with Japan <unk> in 1941 , but these proved inadequate 
 In December 1941 , the Australian Army in the Pacific comprised the 8th Division , most of which was stationed in Malaya , and eight partially trained and equipped divisions in Australia 
 The RAAF was equipped with 373 aircraft , most of which were obsolete trainers , and the <unk> had three cruisers and two destroyers in Australian waters 
The Australian military suffered a series of defeats during the early months of the Pacific War 
 The 8th Division and RAAF squadrons in Malaya formed a part of the British Commonwealth forces which were unable to stop a smaller Japanese invasion force which landed on 7 December 
 The British Commonwealth force withdrew to Singapore at the end of January , but was forced to surrender on 15 February after the Japanese captured much of the island 
 Smaller Australian forces were also overwhelmed and defeated during early 1942 at Rabaul , and in Ambon , Timor , and Java 
 The Australian town of Darwin was heavily bombed by the Japanese on 19 February , to prevent it from being used as an Allied base 
 Over 22 @,@ 000 Australians were taken prisoner in early 1942 and endured harsh conditions in Japanese captivity 
 The prisoners were subjected to <unk> , denied medical treatment and frequently beaten and killed by their guards 
 As a result , 8 @,@ 296 Australian prisoners died in captivity 
Australians played a central role in the New Guinea campaign during 1942 and 1943 
 After an attempt to land troops at Port Moresby was defeated in the Battle of the Coral Sea , the Japanese attempted to capture the strategically important town by advancing overland across the Owen Stanley Ranges and Milne Bay 
 Australian Army units defeated these offensives in the <unk> Track campaign and Battle of Milne Bay with the support of the RAAF and USAAF 
 Australian and US Army units subsequently assaulted and captured the Japanese bases on the north coast of Papua in the hard @-@ fought Battle of <unk> @-@ <unk> 
 The Australian Army also defeated a Japanese attempt to capture the town of <unk> in January 1943 and went onto the offensive in the <unk> @-@ Lae campaign in April 
 In late 1943 , the 7th and 9th Divisions played an important role in Operation <unk> , when they landed to the east and west of Lae and secured the <unk> Peninsula during the <unk> Peninsula campaign and <unk> Range campaign 
Australia 's role in the Pacific War declined from 1944 
 The increasing size of the US forces in the Pacific rendered the Australian military superfluous and labour shortages forced the Government to reduce the size of the armed forces to boost war production 
 Nevertheless , the Government wanted the Australian military to remain active , and agreed to MacArthur 's proposals that it be used in relatively unimportant campaigns 
 In late 1944 , Australian troops and RAAF squadrons replaced US garrisons in eastern New Guinea , New Britain , and <unk> , and launched offensives aimed at destroying or containing the remaining Japanese forces there 
 In May 1945 , I Corps , the Australian First Tactical Air Force and USAAF and USN units began the Borneo Campaign , which continued until the end of the war 
 These campaigns contributed little to Japan 's defeat and remain controversial 
Following Japan 's surrender on 15 August 1945 Australia assumed responsibility for occupying much of Borneo and the eastern Netherlands East Indies until British and Dutch colonial rule was restored 
 Australian authorities also conducted a number of war crimes trials of Japanese personnel 
 <unk> @,@ 000 Australians enlisted during the war , while <unk> @,@ 000 served overseas 
 Casualties included 39 @,@ 767 killed and another 66 @,@ <unk> were wounded 
 20 Victoria Crosses were awarded to Australians 
The <unk> of the Australian military following the end of the Second World War was completed in 1947 
 Plans for post @-@ war defence arrangements were <unk> on maintaining a relatively strong peacetime force 
 It was envisioned that the Royal Australian Navy maintaining a fleet that would include two light fleet carriers , two cruisers , six destroyers , 16 others ships in commission and another 52 in reserved 
 The Royal Australian Air Force would have a strength of 16 squadrons , including four manned by the Citizen Air Force 
 Meanwhile , in a significant departure from previous Australian defence policy which had previously relied on citizen forces , the Australian Army would include a permanent field force of 19 @,@ 000 regulars organised into a brigade of three infantry battalions with armoured support , serving alongside a part @-@ time force of 50 @,@ 000 men in the Citizen Military Forces 
 The Australian Regular Army was subsequently formed on 30 September 1947 , while the <unk> was re @-@ raised on 1 July 1948 
In the immediate post @-@ war period Australia contributed significant forces to the Allied occupation of Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force ( <unk> ) , which included forces from Australia , Britain , India and New Zealand 
 At its height in 1946 the Australian component consisted of an infantry brigade , four warships and three fighter squadrons , totalling 13 @,@ 500 personnel 
 The Australian Army component initially consisted of the 34th Brigade which arrived in Japan in February 1946 and was based in <unk> Prefecture 
 The three infantry battalions raised for occupation duties were designated the 1st , 2nd and 3rd battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment in 1949 , and the 34th Brigade became the 1st Brigade when it returned to Australia in December 1948 , forming the basis of the post @-@ war Regular Army 
 From that time the Australian Army contribution to the occupation of Japan was reduced to a single under @-@ strength battalion 
 Australian forces remained until September 1951 when the <unk> ceased operations , although by the time the majority of units had been committed to the fighting on the Korean <unk> following the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 
 The RAAF component consisted of Nos
 76 , 77 and 82 Squadrons as part of No
 81 Wing RAAF flying P @-@ 51 Mustangs , initially based at <unk> from March 1946 , before transferring to <unk> in 1948 
 However , by 1950 only No
 77 Squadron remained in Japan 
 A total of ten <unk> warships served in Japan during this period , including <unk> Ships Australia , Hobart , Shropshire , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Murchison , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , while <unk> Ships <unk> , <unk> and <unk> also provided support 
During the early years of the Cold War , Australian defence planning assumed that in the event of the outbreak of a global war between the Western world and Eastern bloc countries it would need to contribute forces under collective security arrangements as part of the United Nations , or a coalition led by either the United States or Britain 
 The Middle East was considered the most likely area of operations for Australian forces , where they would most likely operate with British forces 
 Early commitments included the involvement of RAAF aircrew during the Berlin <unk> in 1948 – 49 and the deployment of No
 78 Wing RAAF to Malta in the Mediterranean from 1952 to 1954 
 Meanwhile , defence preparedness initiatives included the introduction of a National Service Scheme in 1951 to provide manpower for the citizen forces of the Army , RAAF and <unk> 
On 25 June 1950 , the North Korean Army ( KPA ) crossed the border into South Korea and advanced for the capital Seoul , which fell in less than a week 
 North Korean forces continued toward the port of Pusan and two days later the United States offered its assistance to South Korea 
 In response the United Nations Security Council requested members to assist in <unk> the North Korean attack 
 Australia initially contributed P @-@ 51 Mustang fighter @-@ bomber aircraft from No
 77 Squadron RAAF and infantry from the 3rd Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment ( 3 RAR ) , both of which were stationed in Japan as part of the <unk> 
 In addition , it provided the majority of supply and support personnel to the British Commonwealth Forces Korea 
 The <unk> frigate <unk> <unk> , and the destroyer <unk> <unk> , were also committed 
 Later , an aircraft carrier strike group aboard <unk> Sydney was added to the force 
By the time 3 RAR arrived in Pusan on 28 September , the North Koreans were in retreat following the <unk> landings 
 As a part of the invasion force under the UN Supreme Commander , General Douglas MacArthur , the battalion moved north and was involved in its first major action at Battle of <unk> near <unk> on 22 October , before advancing towards the <unk> River 
 Further successful actions followed at <unk> on 25 – 26 October 1950 and at <unk> on 29 October 1950 
 North Korean casualties were heavy , while Australian losses included their commanding officer , Lieutenant Colonel Charles Green , who was wounded in the stomach by artillery fire after the battle and succumbed to his wounds and died two days later on 1 November 
 Meanwhile , during the last weeks of October the Chinese had moved 18 divisions of the People 's Volunteer Army across the <unk> River to reinforce the remnants of the KPA 
 <unk> by US and South Korean intelligence , the 13th Army Group crossed the border on 16 October and penetrated up to 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) into North Korea , and were reinforced in early November by 12 divisions from the 9th Army Group ; in total 30 divisions composed of 380 @,@ 000 men 
 3 RAR fought its first action against the Chinese at <unk> on 5 November 
 The fighting cost the battalion heavily and despite halting a Chinese division the new battalion commander was dismissed in the wake 
 Following the Chinese intervention , the UN forces were defeated in successive battles and 3 RAR was forced to withdraw to the 38th parallel 
A series of battles followed at <unk> on 1 – 4 January 1951 , as the British and Australians occupied defensive positions in an attempt to secure the northern approaches to the South Korean capital 
 Further fighting occurred at <unk> @-@ <unk> on 14 – 17 February 1951 following another Chinese advance , and later at <unk> @-@ San between 7 – 12 March 1951 as the UN resumed the offensive 
 Australian troops subsequently participated in two more major battles in 1951 , with the first taking place during fighting which later became known as the Battle of <unk> 
 On 22 April , Chinese forces attacked the <unk> valley and forced the South Korean defenders to withdraw 
 Australian and Canadian troops were ordered to halt this Chinese advance 
 After a night of fighting the Australians recaptured their positions , at the cost of 32 men killed and 59 wounded 
 In July 1951 , the Australian battalion became part of the combined Canadian , British , Australian , New Zealand , and Indian 1st Commonwealth Division 
 The second major battle took place during Operation Commando and occurred after the Chinese attacked a salient in a bend of the Imjin River 
 The 1st Commonwealth Division counter @-@ attacked on 3 October , capturing a number of objectives including Hill 355 and Hill 317 during the Battle of Maryang San ; after five days the Chinese retreated 
 Australian casualties included 20 dead and 104 wounded 
The <unk> then became locked in static trench warfare akin to the First World War , in which men lived in tunnels , redoubts , and <unk> forts behind barbed wire defences 
 From 1951 until the end of the war , 3 RAR held trenches on the eastern side of the division 's positions in the hills northeast of the Imjin River 
 Across from them were heavily fortified Chinese positions 
 In March 1952 , Australia increased its ground commitment to two battalions , sending 1 RAR 
 This battalion remained in Korea for 12 months , before being replaced by 2 RAR in April 1953 
 The Australians fought their last battle during 24 – 26 July 1953 , with 2 RAR holding off a <unk> Chinese attack along the <unk> River and inflicting significant casualties for the loss of five killed and 24 wounded 
 <unk> were suspended on 27 July 1953 
 17 @,@ 808 Australians served during the war , with 341 killed , 1 @,@ 216 wounded and 30 captured 
The Malayan Emergency was declared on 18 June 1948 , after three estate managers were murdered by members of the Malayan Communist Party ( <unk> ) 
 Australian involvement began in June 1950 , when in response to a British request , six <unk> from No
 1 Squadron and a flight of Dakotas from No
 38 Squadron arrived in Singapore to form part of the British Commonwealth Far East Air Force ( <unk> ) 
 The Dakotas were subsequently used on cargo runs , troop movement , as well as <unk> and <unk> drops , while the Lincoln bombers carried out bombing raids against the Communist Terrorist ( CT ) jungle bases 
 The RAAF were particularly successful , and in one such mission known as Operation <unk> , five Lincoln bombers destroyed 181 communist camps , killed 13 communists and forced one into surrender , in a joint operation with the RAF and ground troops 
 The <unk> were withdrawn in 1958 , and were replaced by Canberra bombers from No
 2 Squadron and CAC Sabres from No
 78 Wing 
 Based at RAAF Base <unk> they also carried out a number ground attack missions against the guerrillas 
Australian ground forces were deployed to Malaya in October 1955 as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve 
 In January 1956 , the first Australian ground forces were deployed on Malaysian peninsula , consisting of the 2nd Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment ( 2 RAR ) 
 2 RAR mainly participated in " <unk> up " operations over the next 20 months , conducting extensive patrolling in and near the CT jungle bases , as part of 28th British Commonwealth Brigade 
 Contact with the enemy was <unk> and results small , achieving relatively few kills 
 2 RAR left Malaysia October 1957 to be replaced by 3 RAR 
 3 RAR underwent six weeks of jungle training and began driving <unk> insurgents back into the jungle of <unk> and <unk> 
 The new battalion extensively patrolled and was involved in food denial operations and ambushes 
 Again contact was limited , although 3 RAR had more success than its predecessor 
 By late 1959 , operations against the <unk> were in their final phase , and most communists had been pushed back and across the Thailand border 
 3 RAR left Malaysia October 1959 and was replaced by 1 RAR 
 Though patrolling the border 1 RAR did not make contact with the insurgents , and in October 1960 it was replaced by 2 RAR , which stayed in Malaysia until August 1963 
 The Malayan Emergency officially ended on 31 July 1960 
At the start of the 1960s , Prime Minister Robert <unk> greatly expanded the Australian military so that it could carry out the Government 's policy of " Forward Defence " in South East Asia 
 In 1964 , <unk> announced a large increase in defence spending 
 The strength of the Australian Army would be increased by 50 % over three years from 22 @,@ 000 to 33 @,@ 000 ; providing a full three @-@ brigade division with nine battalions 
 The RAAF and <unk> would also both be increased by 25 % 
 In 1964 , conscription or National Service was re @-@ introduced under the National Service Act , for selected 20 @-@ year @-@ olds based on date of birth , for a period of two years ' continuous full @-@ time service ( the previous scheme having been suspended in 1959 ) 
In 1961 , three Charles F
 Adams @-@ class destroyers were purchased from the United States to replace the ageing Q @-@ class destroyers 
 Traditionally , the <unk> had purchased designs based on those of the Royal Navy and the purchase of American destroyers was significant 
 <unk> Perth and <unk> Hobart joined the fleet in 1965 , followed by <unk> Brisbane in 1967 
 Other projects included the construction of six River @-@ class frigates , the conversion of the aircraft carrier <unk> Melbourne to an anti @-@ submarine role , the acquisition of ten Wessex helicopters , and the purchase of six Oberon @-@ class submarines 
The RAAF took delivery of their first <unk> fighters in 1967 , <unk> No
 3 , No
 75 and No
 77 Squadrons with them 
 The service also received American F @-@ 111 strike aircraft , C @-@ 130 <unk> transports , P @-@ 3 Orion maritime reconnaissance aircraft and Italian <unk> trainers 
The Indonesia @-@ Malaysia confrontation was fought from 1962 to 1966 between the British Commonwealth and Indonesia over the creation of the Federation of Malaysia , with the Commonwealth attempting to safeguard the security of the new state 
 The war remained limited , and was fought primarily on the island of Borneo , although a number of Indonesian <unk> and airborne incursions onto the Malay Peninsula did occur 
 As part of Australia 's continuing military commitment to the security of Malaysia , army , naval and <unk> units were based there as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve 
 Regardless the Australian government was wary of involvement in a war with Indonesia and initially limited its involvement to the defence of the Malayan peninsula only 
 On two occasions Australian troops from 3 RAR were used to help <unk> up <unk> from <unk> and airborne incursions at <unk> and <unk> , in September and October 1964 
3 RAR deployed to Borneo in March 1965 , and served in <unk> until the end of July , operating on both sides of the border 
 The battalion had four major contacts with Indonesian forces and several smaller ones — including at Sungei <unk> , <unk> and <unk> during which they inflicted heavy casualties on the <unk> — as well as suffering casualties in two mine incidents 
 4 RAR served a less @-@ eventful tour between April and August 1966 , and also operated over the border , successfully <unk> with the <unk> on a number of occasions 
 A squadron of the Special Air Service Regiment ( <unk> ) was also deployed in 1965 and again in 1966 , taking part in cross @-@ border operations and inflicting significant casualties on the <unk> , even though they were often tasked with covert reconnaissance 
 Other units included artillery and engineers , while a number of <unk> ships were involved in shelling Indonesian positions in Borneo and in <unk> <unk> in the Singapore Strait 
 The RAAF played a relatively minor role , although it would have been used far more extensively had the war escalated 
Australia 's involvement in the Vietnam War was driven largely by the rise of communism in Southeast Asia after the Second World War , and the fear of its spread which developed in Australia during the 1950s and early 1960s 
 As a consequence , Australia supported South Vietnam throughout the early 1960s 
 In 1961 and 1962 , the leader of the South Vietnamese government , <unk> <unk> <unk> , asked for assistance from the US and its allies in response to a growing insurgency supported by communist North Vietnam 
 Australia offered 30 military advisors from the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam , which became known simply as " The Team " 
 They arrived in July and August 1962 , beginning Australia 's involvement in the war 
 Later in August 1964 , the RAAF sent a flight of <unk> transport aircraft to the port city of <unk> <unk> 
However , with the security situation in South Vietnam continuing to deteriorate , the US increased its involvement to 200 @,@ 000 combat troops by early 1965 
 Australia also committed ground forces , dispatching the 1 RAR to serve with the US <unk> Airborne Brigade in <unk> <unk> province in June 1965 and it subsequently fought a number of significant actions , including Gang <unk> , Operation <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 In March 1966 , the Australian government announced the deployment of a brigade @-@ sized unit — the 1st Australian Task Force ( 1 <unk> ) — to replace 1 RAR 
 Included were a large number of conscripts , under the increasingly controversial National Service Scheme 
 <unk> of two infantry battalions as well as armour , aviation , artillery and other support arms , the task force was assigned primary responsibility for its own area and was based at <unk> <unk> , in <unk> Tuy Province 
 Included were the Iroquois helicopters of No
 9 Squadron RAAF 
 At the Battle of Long Tan on 18 August 1966 , D Company , 6 RAR with considerable artillery support held off and defeated a Viet Cong force that was at least six times bigger than itself 
 18 Australians were killed and 24 wounded , while 245 communist dead were later recovered from the battlefield 
 The battle allowed the Australians to gain dominance over <unk> Tuy Province and 1 <unk> was not fundamentally challenged again 
 Regardless , during February 1967 the Australians suffered their heaviest casualties in the war to that point , losing 16 men killed and 55 wounded in a single week , the bulk during Operation <unk> 
Yet with the <unk> Tuy province coming progressively under control throughout 1967 , the Australians increasingly spent a significant period of time conducting operations further afield 
 1 <unk> was subsequently deployed <unk> infiltration routes leading to Saigon to <unk> communist movement against the capital as part of Operation <unk> during the 1968 <unk> Offensive and later during the Battle of Coral – <unk> in May and June 1968 
 At Fire Support <unk> Coral and <unk> the Australians had clashed with regular North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong main force units operating in battalion and regimental strength for the first time in near conventional warfare , ultimately fighting their largest , most hazardous and most sustained battle of the war 
 During 26 days of fighting Australian casualties included 25 killed and 99 wounded , while communist casualties included 267 killed confirmed by body count , 60 possibly killed , 7 wounded and 11 captured 
 Other significant Australian actions included Binh Ba in June 1969 , <unk> <unk> in late @-@ December 1968 and early 1969 and Long <unk> in June 1971 
 At the height of the Australian commitment , 1 <unk> numbered 8 @,@ 500 troops , including three infantry battalions , armour , artillery , engineers , logistics and aviation units in support 
 A third RAAF unit , No
 2 Squadron RAAF , flying Canberra bombers , was sent in 1967 , and four <unk> destroyers joined US patrols in the waters off North Vietnam 
The Australian withdrawal effectively commenced in November 1970 
 As a consequence of the overall allied strategy of Vietnamization and with the Australian government keen to reduce its own commitment to the war , 8 RAR was not replaced at the end of its tour of duty 
 1 <unk> was again reduced to just two infantry battalions , albeit with significant armour , artillery and aviation support remaining 
 Australian combat forces were further reduced during 1971 as part of a phased withdrawal , and 1 <unk> ceased operations in October 
 Meanwhile , the advisors remained to train South Vietnamese troops until withdrawn on 18 December 1972 by the newly elected Labor government of <unk> <unk> 
 The last Australian forces were finally withdrawn in 1973 
 The Vietnam War was Australia 's longest and most controversial war and although initially enjoying broad support , as the nation 's military involvement increased a vocal anti @-@ war movement developed 
 More than 50 @,@ 000 Australians served in Vietnam ; <unk> were killed and 2 @,@ 398 were wounded 
 Four were awarded the Victoria Cross 
In line with this goal , the <unk> was <unk> to increase its ability to strike at enemy forces from Australian bases and to counter raids on continental Australia 
 This was achieved by increasing the capabilities of the <unk> and RAAF , and relocating regular Army units to Northern Australia 
 During this time the <unk> had no military units on operational deployment outside Australia 
 However , in 1987 the <unk> made its first operational deployment as part of Operation Morris Dance , in which several warships and a rifle company deployed to the waters off Fiji in response to the 1987 <unk> coups d 'état 
 While broadly successful , this deployment highlighted the need for the <unk> to improve its capability to rapidly respond to <unk> events 
During this period Australia continued to retain forces in Malaysia as part of the Five Power Defence <unk> ( <unk> ) agreed in 1971 to defend it in the event of external attack , with this commitment initially including significant air , ground and naval forces 
 However , these forces were gradually reduced with the infantry battalion withdrawn from Singapore in 1973 , and the two <unk> fighter squadrons in 1988 
 Since then a detachment of Orion maritime patrol aircraft , support personnel , and an infantry company known as Rifle Company <unk> have been maintained , as well as occasional deployments of F / A @-@ 18 <unk> fighter aircraft 
 Australian submarines were reportedly also involved in a number of clandestine surveillance missions throughout Asian waters in the last decades of the Cold War 
 <unk> and Navy units were also involved in tracking Soviet ship and submarine movements in the region 
 Since then the <unk> have continued to participate in maritime security operations as part of Operation Gateway , conducting patrols over the Indian Ocean , Strait of <unk> and South China Sea 
 They have reportedly also been involved in freedom of navigation flights 
Australia was a member of the international coalition which contributed military forces to the 1991 Gulf War , deploying a naval task group of two warships , a support ship and a clearance diving team ; in total about 750 personnel 
 The Australian contribution was the first time Australian personnel were deployed to an active war zone since the establishment of the <unk> and the deployment tested its capabilities and command structure 
 However , the Australian force did not see combat , and instead playing a significant role in enforcing the sanctions put in place against Iraq following the invasion of Kuwait 
 Some <unk> personnel serving on exchange with British and American units did see combat , and a few were later decorated for their actions 
 Following the war , the Navy regularly deployed a frigate to the Persian Gulf or Red Sea to enforce the trade sanctions which continued to be applied to Iraq 
 A number of Australian airmen and ground crew posted to or on exchange with US and British air forces subsequently participated in enforcing no @-@ fly zones imposed over Iraq between 1991 and 2003 
Since the late 1980s , the Australian government had increasingly called upon the <unk> to contribute forces to peacekeeping missions around the world 
 While most of these deployments involved only small numbers of specialists , several led to the deployment of hundreds of personnel 
 Large peacekeeping deployments were made to <unk> in early 1989 , Cambodia between 1992 and 1993 , Somalia in 1993 , <unk> between 1994 and 1995 and <unk> in 1994 and from 1997 onwards 
 The 1996 election of the Howard Liberal government resulted in significant reforms to the <unk> 's force structure and role , with the new government 's defence strategy placed less singular emphasis on defending Australia from direct attack and greater emphasis on working in co @-@ operation with regional states and Australia 's allies to manage potential security threats in recognition of Australia 's global security interests 
 In line with this new focus , the <unk> 's force structure changed in an attempt to increase the proportion of combat units to support units and to improve the <unk> 's combat effectiveness 
The former @-@ Portuguese colony of East Timor was invaded by Indonesia in 1975 , however , following years of violent struggle the new Indonesian government of President <unk> <unk> subsequently agreed to allow the East <unk> to vote on autonomy in 1999 
 The United Nations Mission in East Timor ( <unk> ) was established to organise and conduct the vote , which was held at the end of August 1999 and resulted with 78 @
@ 5 % of voters deciding in favour of independence 
 However , following the announcement of the results pro @-@ Indonesian militias supported by elements of the Indonesian military , launched a campaign of violence , looting and <unk> and many East <unk> were killed , while perhaps more than 500 @,@ 000 were displaced 
 Unable to control the violence , Indonesia subsequently agreed to the deployment of a multinational peacekeeping force 
 Australia , which had contributed police to <unk> , organised and led an international military coalition , known as the International Force for East Timor ( <unk> ) , a non @-@ UN force operating in accordance with UN resolutions 
 The total size of the Australian force committed numbered 5 @,@ 500 personnel , and included a significant ground force , supported by air and naval forces , in the largest single deployment of Australian forces since 1945 
Under the overall command of Australian Major General Peter <unk> , <unk> began arriving on 12 September 1999 and was tasked with restoring peace and security , protecting and supporting <unk> , and facilitating humanitarian assistance operations 
 With the withdrawal of the Indonesian armed forces , police and government officials from East Timor , <unk> re @-@ established its headquarters in Dili on 28 September 
 On 19 October 1999 , Indonesia formally recognised the result of the referendum and shortly thereafter a UN peacekeeping force , the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor ( <unk> ) was established , becoming fully responsible for the administration of East Timor during its transition to independence 
 The hand @-@ over of command of military operations from <unk> to <unk> was completed on 28 February 2000 
 Australia continued to support the UN peacekeeping operation with between 1 @,@ 500 and 2 @,@ 000 personnel , as well as landing craft and <unk> helicopters and remained the largest contributor of personnel to the peacekeeping mission 
 During these operations Australian forces regularly clashed with pro @-@ Indonesian militia and on a number of occasions Indonesian forces as well , especially along the border with West Timor 
 Significant actions occurred in <unk> , <unk> <unk> and at <unk> in October 1999 
 However , with the security situation <unk> the bulk of the Australian and UN forces were withdrawn by 2005 
 Two Australians died from non @-@ battle related causes , while a number were wounded in action 
Shortly after the Islamist inspired terrorist attacks in New York and Washington on 11 September 2001 , Australian forces were committed to the American @-@ led international coalition against terrorism 
 The <unk> 's most visible contribution — codenamed Operation <unk> — has been a special forces task group operating in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2002 and again from mid @-@ 2005 to fight against the <unk> 
 Over time the Australian commitment has grown , with the addition of further ground forces in the form of a Reconstruction Task Force from 2006 to provide security , reconstruction and to mentor and train the <unk> National Army 
 Australia has also contributed a frigate and two AP @-@ <unk> Orion surveillance aircraft and three C @-@ 130 <unk> transport aircraft to international operations in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean since 2001 , supporting both the operations in Afghanistan and those in Iraq under Operation <unk> 
 A detachment of four F / A @-@ 18 <unk> fighter @-@ bombers was based at Diego Garcia from late @-@ 2001 to mid @-@ 2002 , while two Boeing <unk> air @-@ to @-@ air <unk> aircraft were also based in Manas Air Base in <unk> to provide support to coalition aircraft operating in <unk> airspace but were later withdrawn 
 A Special Operations Task Group was deployed to support the Reconstruction <unk> in April 2007 
 In addition to radar crews , logistics and intelligence officers , and security personnel , this brought the number of Australian personnel in Afghanistan to 950 by mid @-@ 2007 , with further small increases to 1 @,@ 000 in mid @-@ 2008 , 1 @,@ 100 in early 2009 and 1 @,@ 550 in mid @-@ 2009 
A modest force remained in Afghanistan over this time and was involved in counter @-@ insurgency operations in <unk> Province in conjunction United States and other coalition forces , including the Dutch prior to their withdrawal 
 The force consisted of motorised infantry , special forces , engineers , cavalry , artillery and aviation elements 
 By 2010 it included a combined arms battalion @-@ sized battle group known as the <unk> Task Force , and the Special Operations Task Group , both based at Forward Operation Base Ripley outside of <unk> <unk> , as well as the <unk> Wing Group flying CH @-@ <unk> <unk> , the Force <unk> <unk> and an RAAF air surveillance radar unit based in <unk> 
 In addition , a further 800 Australian logistic personnel were also based in the Middle East in support , but are located outside of Afghanistan 
 Meanwhile , <unk> of maritime patrol and transport aircraft continued to support operations in Iraq and Afghanistan , based out of Al <unk> Air Base in the United Arab Emirates 
 Also included is the deployment of one of the <unk> 's frigates to the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Aden on counter piracy and maritime interdiction duties 
Australian forces were at times involved in heavy fighting , and significant actions included Operation <unk> in 2002 and Operation Perth in 2006 , as well as actions in <unk> in 2007 , <unk> in 2009 , the Shah <unk> <unk> and <unk> in 2010 , and <unk> in 2011 ; although others have yet to be publicly acknowledged due to operational security requirements 
 Casualties include 41 killed and 256 wounded , while another Australian also died serving with the British Army 
 Four Australians have been awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia , the first such decorations in forty years 
 Following a <unk> in forces , the last combat troops were withdrawn on 15 December 2013 ; however , approximately 400 personnel remain in Afghanistan as trainers and advisers , and are stationed in <unk> and <unk> 
 Over 26 @,@ 000 Australian personnel have served in Afghanistan 
Australian forces later joined British and American forces during the 2003 invasion of Iraq 
 The initial contribution was also a modest one , consisting of just 2 @,@ <unk> personnel — codenamed Operation <unk> 
 Major force elements included special forces , <unk> and fixed wing aviation and naval units 
 Army units included elements from the <unk> and 4th Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment ( Commando ) , a CH @-@ 47 <unk> detachment and a number of other specialist units 
 <unk> units included the amphibious ship <unk> <unk> and the frigates <unk> Darwin and <unk> Anzac , while the RAAF deployed 14 F / A @-@ 18 Hornets from No
 75 Squadron , a number of AP @-@ <unk> <unk> and C @-@ 130 <unk> 
 The Australian Special Forces Task Force was one of the first coalition units forces to cross the border into Iraq , while for a few days , the closest ground troops to Baghdad were from the <unk> 
 During the invasion the RAAF also flew its first combat missions since the Vietnam War , with No
 75 Squadron flying a total of 350 sorties and dropping 122 laser @-@ guided bombs 
The Iraqi military quickly proved no match for coalition military power , and with their defeat the bulk of Australian forces were withdrawn 
 While Australia did not initially take part in the post @-@ war occupation of Iraq , an Australian Army light armoured <unk> — designated the Al <unk> Task Group and including 40 <unk> light armoured vehicles and infantry — was later deployed to Southern Iraq in April 2005 as part of Operation <unk> 
 The role of this force was to protect the Japanese engineer contingent in the region and support the training of New Iraqi Army units 
 The <unk> later became the <unk> Battle Group ( West ) ( <unk> ( W ) ) , following the hand back of Al <unk> province to Iraqi control 
 Force levels peaked at 1 @,@ 400 personnel in May 2007 including the <unk> ( W ) in Southern Iraq , the Security Detachment in Baghdad and the Australian Army Training Team — Iraq 
 A <unk> frigate was based in the North Persian Gulf , while RAAF assets included C @-@ <unk> <unk> and AP @-@ <unk> elements 
 Following the election of a new Labor government under Prime Minister Kevin <unk> the bulk of these forces were withdrawn by mid @-@ 2009 , while RAAF and <unk> operations were <unk> to other parts of the Middle East Area of Operations as part of Operation <unk> 
Low @-@ level operations continued , however , with a small Australian force of 80 soldiers remaining in Iraq to protect the Australian Embassy in Baghdad as part of <unk> under Operation <unk> 
 <unk> was finally withdrawn in August 2011 , and was replaced by a private military company which took over responsibility for providing security for Australia 's diplomatic presence in Iraq 
 Although more than 17 @,@ 000 personnel served during operations in Iraq , Australian casualties were relatively light , with two soldiers accidentally killed , while a third Australian died serving with the British Royal Air Force 
 A further 27 personnel were wounded 
 Two officers remained in Iraq attached to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq as part of Operation <unk> 
 This operation concluded in November 2013 
In June 2014 a small number of <unk> personnel were deployed to Iraq to protect the Australian embassy when the security of Baghdad was threatened by the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive 
 Later , in August and September a number of RAAF C @-@ 17 and C @-@ <unk> transport aircraft based in the Middle East were used to conduct <unk> of humanitarian aid to trapped civilians and to <unk> arms and munitions to forces in Kurdish @-@ controlled northern Iraq 
 In late September 2014 an Air Task Group ( <unk> ) and Special Operations Task Group ( <unk> ) were deployed to Al <unk> Air Base in the United Arab Emirates as part of the coalition to combat Islamic State forces in Iraq 
 <unk> with F / A @-@ <unk> Super <unk> strike aircraft , a <unk> @-@ <unk> Multi Role <unk> Transport , and an E @-@ <unk> <unk> Airborne Early Warning & Control aircraft , the <unk> began operations on 1 October 
 The <unk> is tasked with operations to advise and assist Iraqi Security Forces , and was deployed to Iraq after a legal framework covering their presence in the country was agreed between the Australian and Iraqi Governments 
 It began moving into Iraq in early November 
 In April 2015 a 300 @-@ strong unit known as Task Group <unk> was deployed to Iraq to train the regular Iraqi Security Forces 
 <unk> were extended to Syria in September 2015 
Australia 's involvement in international peacekeeping operations has been diverse , and included participation in both United Nations sponsored missions , as well as those as part of ad @-@ hoc coalitions 
 Australians have been involved in more conflicts as peacekeepers than as <unk> ; however " in comparative international terms , Australia has only been a moderately energetic <unk> 
 " Although Australia has had peacekeepers in the field continuously for 60 years — being among the first group of UN military observers in Indonesia in 1947 — its commitments have generally been limited , consisting mostly of small numbers of high @-@ level and technical support troops such as <unk> , engineers , <unk> , observers , and police 
 One significant commitment has been Australia 's ongoing involvement with the long running <unk> Force and Observers in the Sinai 
 The operational tempo started increasing in the mid @-@ 1990s , when Australia became involved in a series of high @-@ profile operations , deploying significantly larger combat units in support of a number of missions including Cambodia , <unk> , Somalia , East Timor , and the Solomon Islands 
 Australia has been involved in close to 100 separate missions , involving more than 30 @,@ 000 personnel ; 14 Australians have died during these operations 
In March 2005 the University of Colorado began investigating allegations that Churchill had engaged in research <unk> ; it reported in June 2006 that he had done so 
 Churchill was fired on July 24 , 2007 , leading to a claim by some scholars that he was fired because of the " Little <unk> " comment 
 Churchill filed a lawsuit against the University of Colorado for unlawful termination of employment 
 In April 2009 a Denver jury found that Churchill was wrongly fired , <unk> him $ 1 in damages 
 In July 2009 , a District Court judge vacated the monetary award and declined Churchill 's request to order his <unk> , deciding the university has " quasi @-@ judicial immunity " 
 In February 2010 , Churchill appealed the judge 's decision 
 In November 2010 , the Colorado Court of Appeals upheld the lower @-@ court 's ruling 
 In September 10 , 2012 , the Colorado Supreme Court upheld the lower courts ' decisions in favor of the University of Colorado 
 On April 1 , 2013 , the United States Supreme Court declined to hear the case 
You could say that five hundred years ago was the basis of blood quantum in <unk> @-@ America 
 But in Anglo @-@ America , while there was some preoccupation with it , it was not formalized until the passage of the General <unk> Act , mid @-@ 1880s 
 At that point they began to define Indian as being someone who was <unk> and <unk> of at least one @-@ quarter by quantum blood indigenous in a given group 
 You couldn 't be an eighth Cheyenne and an eighth <unk> and be an Indian 
 You had to be a quarter Cheyenne or a quarter <unk> or hopefully a quarter and a quarter 
 The reason for this was quite clear 
 They were identifying Indians for purposes of <unk> them individual <unk> of land in the existing reservation base at that point 
 If they ran out of Indians identifiable as such , then the rest of the land would be declared surplus 
 So it was clearly in the interests of the government to create a definition of <unk> that would minimize the number of Indians that were available 
 It was an economic motivation for the application of this genetic criteria to <unk> in the first place 
 It 's become increasingly so ever since

 Z Magazine 
In June 2005 , the Rocky Mountain News published an article about Churchill 's genealogy and family history 
 It " turned up no evidence of a single Indian ancestor " among 142 direct ancestors [ of Churchill 's ] identified from records 
 The News reported that both Churchill 's birth parents were listed as white on the 1930 census , as were all but two of his great @-@ great @-@ grandparents listed on previous census and other official documents 
 The News found that some of Churchill 's accounts of where his ancestors had lived did not agree with documented records 
 Numerous members of Churchill 's extended family have longstanding family legends of Indian ancestry among ancestors ; but , none was confirmed among the 142 direct forebears of Churchill who were identified 
In 1986 , Churchill wrote an essay titled <unk> as <unk> : Notes on an American <unk> criticizing pacifist politics within the U
S
 left as being <unk> , de facto racist and <unk> 
 In 1998 , <unk> Ring Publishing published the essay in a book entitled <unk> as <unk> : Reflections on the Role of Armed <unk> in North America and listing Ward Churchill as the author 
 The book included a preface by Ed Mead , a new introduction to the essay by Churchill and a commentary by Mike Ryan 
 The book sparked much debate in leftist circles and inspired more aggressive tactics within the anti @-@ <unk> movement in the following few years 
Churchill 's Indians Are Us ? ( 1994 ) , a sequel to Fantasies of the Master Race , further explores American Indian issues in popular culture and politics 
 He examines the movie Black Robe , the Pine Ridge Indian <unk> killings , the prosecution of Leonard <unk> , sports <unk> , the Indian Arts and <unk> Act of 1990 , and blood quantum laws , calling them tools of <unk> 
 Churchill is particularly outspoken about New Age <unk> of <unk> and American Indian sacred traditions , and the " do @-@ it @-@ yourself <unk> " of certain contemporary authors 
 John P
 <unk> of the University of New Mexico School of Law published a review of Indians Are Us ? in The American Indian Quarterly 
 Professor <unk> , an enrolled member of the <unk> Sioux Nation , states that Indians Are Us ? twists historical facts and is hostile toward Indian tribes 
 It was in this book that Churchill first made the claim that the United States distributed " smallpox @-@ infested blankets " to Indian tribes , a claim which he repeated several times over the next decade 
 The claim has been criticized as a <unk> 
 Churchill has , however , received support from some scholars 
In <unk> of Justice ( 2002 ) , Churchill argues that the U
S
 ' s legal system was adapted to gain control over Native American people 
 <unk> the evolution of federal Indian law , Churchill argues that the principles set forth were not only applied to non @-@ Indians in the U
S
 , but later adapted for application abroad 
 He concludes that this demonstrates the development of the U
S
 ' s " imperial logic , " which depends on a " corrupt form of <unk> " to establish colonial control and empire 
Churchill 's controversial essay on 9 / 11 was expanded into a book @-@ length manuscript , published as On the Justice of <unk> <unk> : Reflections on the <unk> of U
S
 Imperial <unk> and <unk> ( 2003 ) by AK Press 
 The book features two other chapters , one listing US military <unk> , another listing what Churchill believes to be US violations of international law 
 The original essay takes the " roosting chickens " of the title from a 1963 Malcolm X speech , in which Malcolm X linked the assassination of U
S
 president John F
 Kennedy to the violence which Kennedy <unk> as " merely a case of chickens coming home to roost 
 " Churchill 's essays in this book address the worldwide forms of resistance that he posits were and continue to be provoked by U
S
 imperialism of the 20th and 21st centuries 
Churchill has been active since at least 1984 as the co @-@ director of the Denver @-@ based American Indian Movement of Colorado , now an autonomous chapter of the American Indian Movement 
 In 1993 , he and other local <unk> leaders , including Russell <unk> , Glenn T
 Morris , Robert <unk> , and David Hill , broke with the national <unk> leadership , including Dennis Banks and the brothers Vernon and Clyde <unk> , claiming that all <unk> chapters are autonomous 
 The <unk> Grand <unk> Council is based in Minneapolis and retains the name of the national group 
 It says that the schism arose when <unk> , Churchill , Glenn T
 Morris and others openly supported the <unk> Indian group <unk> , who were allied with the anti @-@ revolutionary , CIA @-@ backed <unk> 
Looking Cloud and Graham were convicted of murder in 2004 and 2010 , by federal and South Dakota state <unk> , respectively 
 By then Clark was being cared for in a nursing home and was not indicted 
 <unk> attributed the split in <unk> to divisions in the aftermath of <unk> 's murder 
 The journalist <unk> <unk> said in 1999 , " 


 her [ <unk> 's ] death has divided the American Indian Movement 


The schism continued , with the national <unk> leadership claiming that the local <unk> leaders , such as Churchill , are tools of the U
S
 government used against other American Indians 
 The leaders of the national <unk> organization , now called <unk> Grand <unk> Council , claim that Churchill has worked in the past as an underground counter @-@ intelligence source for the U
S
 government , for example the FBI , and local , non @-@ Indian , police forces , to <unk> the national <unk> organization 
 Specifically , they refer to a 1993 Boulder , Colorado interview with <unk> <unk> , a former columnist for the Denver Post , in which Churchill stated that he " was teaching the Rapid City Police Department about the American Indian Movement 
 " In addition , Vernon <unk> accused Churchill of having ' <unk> represented himself as an Indian ' to bolster his credentials 
 <unk> said he complained to the University of Colorado about this as early as 1986 
Churchill wrote an essay in September 2001 entitled On the Justice of <unk> <unk> 
 In it , he argued that the September 11 attacks were provoked by U
S
 foreign policy 
 He compared the role of financial workers at the World Trade Center in " ongoing <unk> American imperialism " to the role played by Adolf <unk> in organizing the Holocaust 
 In 2005 , this essay was widely publicized when Hamilton College invited Churchill to speak 
 This led to both condemnations of Churchill and counter @-@ accusations of <unk> by Churchill and supporters 
 Following the controversy , the University of Colorado interim Chancellor Phil <unk> said , " While Professor Churchill has the constitutional right to express his political views , his essay on 9 / 11 has outraged and <unk> us and the general public 
On May 16 , 2006 the University released their findings ; the <unk> Committee agreed unanimously that Churchill had engaged in " serious research <unk> " , including <unk> , fabrication , and two of the three allegations of plagiarism 
 The committee was divided on the appropriate level of sanctions 
 The Standing Committee on Research <unk> accepted the findings of the <unk> Committee but also disagreed on what sanctions should be imposed 
 Churchill 's appeal against his proposed dismissal was considered by a panel of the University 's <unk> and <unk> Committee , which found that two of the seven findings of <unk> did not constitute <unk> offences 
 Three members recommended that the penalty should be demotion and one year 's suspension without pay , while two favored dismissal 
The next day , Churchill filed a lawsuit in state court claiming that the firing was <unk> for his expressing politically unpopular views 
 The jury in Churchill 's suit for <unk> weighed the university 's claims of academic <unk> per jury instructions it received in the case 
 As Stanley Fish said , " It was the jury ’ s task to determine whether Churchill ’ s dismissal would have occurred independently of the adverse political response to his <unk> protected statements 
 " The jury found that the alleged <unk> would not have led to Churchill 's firing and rejected the university 's academic <unk> claim as the grounds for dismissal 
 On April 1 , 2009 , a Colorado jury found that Churchill had been wrongly fired , and awarded $ 1 in damages 
 As one of the jurors said later in a press interview , " it wasn 't a <unk> in his face or anything like that when we didn 't give him any money 
 It 's just that [ Churchill 's attorney ] David Lane kept saying this wasn 't about the money , and in the end , we took his word for that 
 " Churchill 's counsel asked Chief Judge Larry J
 <unk> of the Denver District Court to order <unk> in light of the verdict 
Churchill appealed both decisions 
 On November 24 , 2010 , a three @-@ judge panel of the Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court 's decision 
 In February 2011 , Churchill filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the Colorado Supreme Court 
 In late May 2011 , the Colorado Supreme Court agreed to hear his case 
 Court records indicate that oral arguments began June 7 , 2012 
 On September 10 , 2012 , the court ruled that the University had " quasi @-@ judicial immunity " , upholding the trial court 's ruling 
 On April 1 , 2013 , the U
S
 Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from Churchill

The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) 
 First held in 1829 , the race takes place on the 4 @
@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @
@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London 
 The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide 
 Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions , having beaten Oxford by over a length in the previous year 's race and the overall lead , with 79 victories to Oxford 's 73 
 The race was sponsored by <unk> for the fourth time 
Oxford 's crew weighed an average of 12 pounds ( 5 @
@ 4 kg ) more per rower than their opponents , and featured the oldest competitor in Boat Race history in 36 @-@ year @-@ old American Mike <unk> 
 Cambridge crew consisted of six Britons , two Australians and an American , while Oxford 's comprised four Americans , three Britons , an Australian and a German 
 Both <unk> , Nick <unk> and Rebecca <unk> , were former Blues , while Cambridge also saw 30 @-@ year @-@ old Tom Edwards return , having rowed in 2006 
 Cambridge 's boat club president Dan O <unk> was the seventh Light Blue president not to row in his own Blue Boat 
Oxford were pre @-@ race favourites , but Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station 
 Oxford took an early lead , but the boats closed on each other , and <unk> John Garrett was forced to issue a number of warnings to both <unk> in an attempt to prevent a collision 
 By <unk> <unk> , Oxford were nearly a length ahead and Cambridge responded ; by the time the crews passed under <unk> Bridge they were level 
 Along <unk> <unk> Oxford moved ahead once again , and were clear of Cambridge after 30 <unk> 
 Oxford extended their lead to pass the finishing post in 20 minutes 53 seconds , six lengths and 22 seconds ahead of their opponents 
 Driving rain , strong winds and <unk> water resulted in the slowest winning time for over sixty years , but the largest margin of victory since the 2004 race 
The <unk> of Indian Territory ( now Oklahoma ) were upset to have Fort Wayne in their proximity 
 After some delay , the US Army decided to abandon Fort Wayne and move its soldiers to a new fort to be built between Fort <unk> and the site 
 The Army both wanted to <unk> the <unk> ( who were supervised by the Department of Defense ) and provide more defense for white settlers and other Indians against the Osage , who had been conducting frequent raids in the area 
 On April 1 , 1842 , some soldiers of Fort Wayne left their fort and on April 22 arrived where Fort Scott would be built , in the Osage <unk> section of modern @-@ day Kansas 
 After <unk> with the <unk> to acquire the land , the rest of Fort Wayne 's garrison left the fort on May 26 and arrived at the Fort Scott site on May 30 
The post <unk> , Captain Thomas Swords , was in charge of building Fort Scott 's structures , and had to deal with the problems of construction on the Kansas prairie , which had few trees 
 He had only two <unk> and three carpenters to rely on , as there were few civilians and most of the soldiers had other duties to perform 
 Wood was available , but the mill was built 1 @
@ 5 miles ( 2 @
@ 4 km ) away , making transport time consuming 
 Swords found his efforts plagued by lack of wood , skilled labor and working equipment 
 Freak accidents destroyed much of the wood intended for the fort 's construction 
 As a result , only one <unk> of the five planned officers quarters ( four <unk> and post commandant 's house ) was built by 1844 , and the intended enlisted barracks were not completed 
 In his 1844 inspection of the fort , Colonel George <unk> reported that , in comparison to other frontier forts , he considered Fort Scott " above average " 
For the average soldier , life at the fort was " <unk> " 
 Until the permanent structures were built , soldiers had to live in tents , which lacked comfort 
 Aside from a few whiskey <unk> and prostitutes , few civilians lived at the fort 
 Officers had brought their personal slaves with them , including Captain Swords 
 Five miles East in Missouri was a <unk> shop that supplied soldiers , and quite a few courts @-@ martial followed soldiers ' going <unk> at the shop 
 The <unk> rate from the fort ranged from 12 % <unk> % , due to boredom , irregular pay , and hatred for military life 
 As no combat took place near the fort , it seemed more of a frontier village than a military base 
 Hunting was a popular <unk> ; according to Captain Swords , " wolf chasing and duck hunting " was the only way one officer could tolerate the place 
Two years after the army abandoned the fort , the buildings were sold by auction to civilians , with two being converted to hotels 
 In 1854 the Kansas @-@ Nebraska Act repealed the Missouri <unk> of 1820 , which had kept slavery out of Kansas 
 <unk> in favor of slavery soon moved to Kansas to try to sway the vote of whether or not Kansas would permit slavery 
 Settlers from New England arrived equally determined to keep it out 
 Each of the two competing factions of the Bleeding Kansas conflict claimed one of the hotels at Fort Scott : Free @-@ Soil at the Fort Scott Hotel and Pro @-@ <unk> at the Western Hotel 
 Most of the residents in Fort Scott supported slavery , but those outside the town tended to the free @-@ soil side 
 During this time , there were local incidents of murder and attempted <unk> , typical elements of the guerrilla conflicts that were prevalent in the fighting 
During the American Civil War , the fort was renewed as a US military post 
 In August 1861 , the Union Army took command of Fort Scott , and <unk> it for the war times 
 The United States Army also took over several blocks within the town for <unk> and <unk> functions 
 The Union Army rented the properties from the current civilian owners 
 Troops from Indiana , Iowa , Colorado , Ohio , and Wisconsin would come to the fort , and either stayed by the fort , or traveled farther , to <unk> Missouri , Arkansas , or the Indian Territory 
 Fort Scott was one of the few installations that recruited and trained black soldiers for the United States <unk> Troops of the Union Army 
A major supply depot was situated at the fort 
 Confederate general Sterling Price hoped to capture the town , but the closest the Confederate force came to the garrison was 10 miles ( 16 km ) away at Battle of Dry Wood Creek 
 The site was strategically important as it was within a Southern @-@ <unk> area and close to the Confederate state of Arkansas and the " unstable " Indian Territory ( present @-@ day state of Oklahoma ) , where many of the members of the Five <unk> <unk> were allied with the Confederates 
 The fort served as a " general hospital " ( large military hospital ) and prison until after the war 
 Following the end of the war , in October 1865 the US Army left the facilities and sold off by auction what they controlled 
On January 14 , 1870 , the Army returned with the formation of the Post of Southeast Kansas 
 The Post was based at Fort Scott , but the soldiers camped along the rail tracks , and seldom used the original fort 
 They were sent to protect the railroads and workers from settlers 
 Some of the latter feared that the railroad , which had been awarded land for development by the US Government in rights @-@ of @-@ way , would evict them from their <unk> homes 
 The settlers considered the troops <unk> to the railroads , and <unk> both as enemies

Home Made <unk> Pie is a 1910 American silent short comedy produced by the Thanhouser Company 
 The film is a comedy of circumstances , in which the Gale family is going to host a dinner 
 The focus of the humor is in a <unk> <unk> that brandy is added to in an attempt to make it more <unk> , but three people each add brandy to the <unk> 
 Everyone becomes <unk> upon eating the <unk> , including the family cat , and the film concludes 
 No cast or staff credits for this film are known 
 The film was released on September 27 , 1910 , to mixed reviews in trade publications 
 Reviewers mentioned that the film was too long and it was unbelievable that one <unk> split eight ways would be able to impact everyone 
 The film is presumed lost 
Though the film is presumed lost , a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from September 24 , 1910 
 It states : " Life in a country town is often tedious and <unk> , and were it not for the little <unk> and <unk> the <unk> are constantly given , existence in some localities would be a very dreary thing indeed 
 So the time honored get @-@ <unk> of the small town are an established feature to the social calendar ; they are just as much a matter of necessity and as such have come to stay 
 The <unk> thought well of this established feature 
 They made it a <unk> occasion for themselves as well as their guests 
 They were hardly an overly wealthy family , and their table was never notable for an <unk> of the good things of life , but whenever they gave a dinner they cast all thoughts of economy to the country winds and worked to the one end that their guests have a pleasant time 
" On the night before such an event neither <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> Gale could get those minutes ' solid sleep for thought that they might have overlooked some essential in the guests ' comfort 
 At the first <unk> of the rooster they would come hopping down to the kitchen to get the <unk> into shape 
 So little wonder that on occasion of the dinner here pictured - when the prize dish was a splendid <unk> <unk> <unk> - the <unk> were ever looking after the need of the said <unk> 
 First <unk> Gale would <unk> to the table whereupon it sat in solemn state , and give it a stir ; then <unk> Gale would <unk> over and give it a stir ; finally <unk> Gale would have to come over and honor it likewise 
 Then arrived the guests 
 The Minister and the Mrs
 Minister , they were , and some neighbors 
 While she was receiving them the recollection came to <unk> Gale that the beloved <unk> <unk> had not received its <unk> 
 Off she speeds to a <unk> of whiskey in the kitchen 
 She <unk> into the <unk> the right proportion of liquor , and goes back to her guests 
 Then <unk> Gale remembers that the <unk> has not been flavored 
 He , too , <unk> himself and a moment later is found pouring whiskey into the sacred <unk> 
 No sooner has he ceased and returned to his guest than <unk> Gale , who has just remembered about the forgotten <unk> , rushes in and makes for the whiskey 
 She <unk> ' the right proportion ' in , too 
The writer of the scenario is unknown , but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan 
 He was an experienced <unk> employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions 
 The film director is unknown , but it may have been Barry O 'Neil 
 Film historian Q
 David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production , but at least two possible candidates exist 
 Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company , but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer 
 The role of the cameraman was <unk> in 1910 productions 
 The cast credits are unknown , but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary 
 In late 1910 , the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films

 A surviving film still gives the possibility of identifying eight actors 
The The Moving Picture World reviewer found the subject to be too long , but did not find it to be a fault 
 The reviewer states , " A domestic comedy with a different flavor 
 In fact , with a <unk> <unk> for a basis the flavor comes to resemble brandy very strongly by the time that the cook , the maid and the mistress of the house and her daughter have added the proper proportion of <unk> , neither one knowing that the others have done likewise 
 The humor in this piece centers around this <unk> 
 What happened to the guests who <unk> of it certainly draws upon the imagination 
 Imagine eight people , not to speak of the cat , getting drunk on the brandy in one <unk> <unk> ! 


 We do not single out this subject as being more evidently padded than others shown on the screen this week 
 <unk> as well as <unk> were guilty and it is time that the manufacturers realize the importance of the scenario end of matters 
 The <unk> <unk> episode was well done , which is the faint praise that we do not like to <unk> out to anyone 
 " Walton of The Moving Picture News was not <unk> by the plot and stated , " To me the last scene had no humor 
 It was only the necessary ending to the beginning 
 True humor does not <unk> from <unk> 
 " The New York Dramatic Mirror stated , " This is the old story of too many cooks , and it is quite funny after the first scenes are out of the way 
 The early part of the film takes too much time with trivial details leading up to the final situation 
 


 A weak point in the story is the fact that the <unk> is cut into eight small pieces , making it difficult to believe in its remarkable power 
 Two <unk> would have been as easy to make as one and would have been more convincing 
 The character parts are all well taken , although the cook would have been better if she had not seized so many opportunities to talk directly at the camera 
" Back Off <unk> " is a song by English musician <unk> Starr , released as a non @-@ album single in March 1972 
 Starr 's former Beatles <unk> George Harrison produced the recording , which took place in London shortly after the two had appeared together at Harrison 's Concert for Bangladesh shows in August 1971 
 The single was a follow @-@ up to Starr 's 1971 hit song " It Don 't Come Easy " and continued his successful run as a solo artist 
 " Back Off <unk> " peaked at number 2 in Britain and Canada , and number 9 on America 's Billboard Hot 100 
 It remains Starr 's highest @-@ charting single in the United Kingdom 
The title for the song was inspired by English singer @-@ songwriter Marc <unk> 
 Some commentators have suggested that the lyrics were directed at Paul McCartney , reflecting Starr 's disdain for the music McCartney had made as a solo artist over the previous two years 
 " Back Off <unk> " demonstrates the influence of <unk> rock on Starr , who directed a documentary film , Born to Boogie ( 1972 ) , about <unk> 's band T
 Rex around this time 
 Described by one author as a " high @-@ energy in @-@ your @-@ face rocker " , the song features a prominent slide guitar part by Harrison and contributions from musicians Gary Wright and Klaus <unk> 
<unk> Starr identified his initial inspiration for " Back Off <unk> " as having come from Marc <unk> , the singer and guitarist with English <unk> rock band T
 Rex 
 In a 2001 interview with <unk> editor Paul Du <unk> , Starr described <unk> as " a dear friend who used to come into the office when I was running Apple Movies , a big office in town , and the hang @-@ out for myself , Harry Nilsson and Keith Moon " 
 Over dinner one evening at Starr 's home outside London , <unk> had used the word " <unk> " so often that it stuck in Starr 's mind , after which the beat and melody for the song came to him overnight 
 When discussing the composition on VH1 <unk> in May 1998 , Starr explained : " [ <unk> ] was an <unk> guy 
 He used to speak : ' Back off <unk> 


 <unk> you , <unk> 
 ' ' Do you want some potatoes ? ' ' <unk> you , <unk> ! ' " Starr also recalled having to take the batteries out of his children 's toys that night , in order to power a tape recorder and make a recording of the new song 
In addition to these supposed messages in " Back Off <unk> " , observers have viewed the song title as Starr 's <unk> to McCartney to abandon his legal stand against the Beatles and Apple Corps , which was placed in receivership in March 1971 after a High Court judge found in McCartney 's favour 
 Author Keith <unk> writes that " <unk> " had " long been cited as Paul 's nickname " from his former bandmates Starr , Lennon and George Harrison 
 While acknowledging that in subsequent years Starr might have chosen to minimise any ill @-@ feeling towards McCartney , Rodriguez notes that the lyrics " just happened to fit perfectly into the ' us vs
 Paul ' mindset " following the Beatles ' break @-@ up , to the extent that " Back Off <unk> " was " as <unk> as ' Early 1970 ' had been <unk> " 
 When <unk> his 1970 composition " I 'm the Greatest " for Starr to record on the album <unk> ( 1973 ) , Lennon referenced the song title with the lines " Now I 'm only thirty @-@ two / And all I want to do is <unk> " 
Apple Records issued the single on 17 March 1972 in Britain , as Apple R <unk> , with a US release taking place three days later , as Apple 1849 
 It was Starr 's first release since " It Don 't Come Easy " , a year before 
 During this period , his priority had been to develop a career as an actor in films such as 200 <unk> ( 1971 ) and <unk> 
 Further <unk> himself with Britain 's <unk> rock movement , Starr made his directorial debut with Born to Boogie ( 1972 ) , a film starring <unk> that included Starr 's footage of a T
 Rex concert held at Wembley on 18 March 
 With " Back Off <unk> " , NME critic Bob <unk> noted Starr 's success in establishing himself in the two years since the Beatles ' break @-@ up , and wrote that the single " confirmed that he and Harrison , dark horses both , were the ones who had managed their solo careers more purposefully and <unk> " compared with McCartney and Lennon 
Alan <unk> writes of reviewers criticising " Back Off <unk> " for being <unk> , leading Starr to respond in a 1973 interview : " Play me a pop song that isn 't 
 " On release , Chris Welch wrote in Melody Maker : " A Number One hit could easily be in store for the <unk> of rock drums 
 There 's a touch of the Marc <unk> in this highly playable rhythmic <unk> 


 It 's hypnotic and effective , ideal for <unk> and liable to send us all mad by the end of the week 
 " <unk> described the single as " every bit as <unk> " as " It Don 't Come Easy " , although " slightly inferior " , while Mike <unk> of AllMusic views it as a song where " [ t ] he <unk> spirit of <unk> Starr shines through " 
 In a 1974 article for the NME , Charles <unk> Murray highlighted " Back Off <unk> " as a " great radio and <unk> @-@ box tune " 
Starr has performed " Back Off <unk> " in concert with his All @-@ Starr Band , beginning with the band 's debut tour of North America in July – September 1989 
 The song was dropped from the concert setlist early in that tour , however , in favour of the 1963 Lennon – McCartney composition " I Wanna Be Your Man " 
 Live versions of " Back Off <unk> " have appeared on the multi @-@ disc compilation The Anthology 


 So Far ( 2001 ) and King <unk> Flower Hour Presents <unk> & His New All @-@ Starr Band ( 2002 ) 
 The latter version was recorded during a US tour in August 2001 , at which point the All @-@ Starr line @-@ up was Starr ( vocals ) , Mark Rivera ( saxophone ) , Ian Hunter ( guitar ) , Roger Hodgson and Howard Jones ( keyboards ) , Greg Lake ( bass ) and <unk> E
 ( drums ) 
" Where the Streets Have No Name " is a song by Irish rock band U2 
 It is the opening track from their 1987 album The Joshua Tree and was released as the album 's third single in August 1987 
 The song 's hook is a repeating guitar <unk> using a delay effect , played during the song 's introduction and again at the end 
 Lead vocalist Bono wrote the lyrics in response to the notion that it is possible to identify a person 's religion and income based on the street on which they lived , particularly in Belfast 
 During the band 's difficulties recording the song , producer Brian Eno considered <unk> the song 's tapes to have them start from scratch 
The music for " Where the Streets Have No Name " originated from a demo that guitarist The Edge composed the night before the group resumed The Joshua Tree sessions 
 In an upstairs room at <unk> House — his newly purchased home — The Edge used a four @-@ track tape machine to record an arrangement of keyboards , bass , guitar , and a drum machine 
 <unk> that the album sessions were approaching the end and that the band were short on exceptional live songs , The Edge wanted to " <unk> up the ultimate U2 live @-@ song " , so he imagined what he would like to hear at a future U2 show if he were a fan 
 After finishing the rough mix , he felt he had come up with " the most amazing guitar part and song of [ his ] life " 
 With no one in the house to share the demo with , The Edge recalls dancing around and punching the air in celebration 
Although the band liked the demo , it was difficult for them to record the song 
 <unk> Adam Clayton said , " At the time it sounded like a foreign language , whereas now we understand how it works " 
 The arrangement , with two time signature shifts and frequent chord changes , was <unk> many times , but the group struggled to get a performance they liked 
 According to co @-@ producer Daniel Lanois , " that was the science project song 
 I remember having this massive schoolhouse <unk> , as we call them 
 I was holding a pointer , like a college professor , walking the band through the chord changes like a fucking <unk> 
 It was ridiculous 
 " Co @-@ producer Brian Eno estimates that half of the album sessions were spent trying to record a suitable version of " Where the Streets Have No Name " 
 The band worked on a single take for weeks , but as Eno explained , that particular version had a lot of problems with it and the group continued trying to fix it up 
 Through all of their work , they had gradually replaced each instrument take until nothing remained from the original performance 
The studio version of the song was compiled from several different takes 
 It was one of several songs mixed by Steve <unk> in the final months of recording The Joshua Tree 
 Drummer Larry Mullen , Jr
 later said of the song , " It took so long to get that song right , it was difficult for us to make any sense of it 
 It only became a truly great song through playing live 
 On the record , musically , it 's not half the song it is live 
" Where the Streets Have No Name " is played at a tempo of 126 beats per minute 
 The introduction and <unk> are played in a 3 / 4 time signature , while the remainder of the song is in a common 4 / 4 signature 
 The songs opens with an instrumental section , starting with <unk> @-@ like sustained <unk> notes 
 The guitar fades in after 42 seconds ; this part consists of a repeated " <unk> " six @-@ note <unk> 
 A " dotted eighth " delay effect is used to " play " each note in the <unk> twice , thus creating a rich sound 
 The bass and drums enter at 1 : 10 
The lyrics were inspired by a story that Bono heard about the streets of Belfast , Northern Ireland , where a person 's religion and income are evident by the street they live on 
 He contrasted this with the <unk> he felt when visiting Ethiopia , saying : " 


 the guy in the song recognizes this contrast and thinks about a world where there aren 't such divisions , a place where the streets have no name 
 To me , that 's the way a great rock ' n ' roll concert should be : a place where everyone comes together 


 Maybe that 's the dream of all art : to break down the barriers and the divisions between people and touch upon the things that matter the most to us all 
 " Bono wrote the lyrics while on a humanitarian visit to Ethiopia with his wife , Ali Hewson ; he first wrote them down on an <unk> bag while staying in a village 
The open @-@ ended nature of the lyrics has led to many interpretations 
 Journalist Michael Campbell believed the lyrics send " a message of hope " and wish for a " world that is not divided by class , wealth , race , or any other arbitrary criterion " 
 With regard to the place Bono was referring to in the song , he said , " I 'm not sure , really , about that 
 I used to think it was Belfast 


 " Journalist Niall Stokes believes the title was influenced by Bono 's and his wife Ali 's visit to Ethiopia as volunteer aid @-@ workers 
 Bono has expressed mixed opinions about the open @-@ ended lyrics : " I can look at it now and recognize that [ the song ] has one of the most <unk> couplets in the history of pop music 
 But it also contains some of the biggest ideas 
 In a curious way , that seems to work 
 If you get any way heavy about these things , you don 't communicate 
 But if you 're flip or <unk> about it , then you do 
 That 's one of the <unk> I 've come to terms with 
Originally , the third single from The Joshua Tree was meant to be the song " Red Hill <unk> Town " , but " Where the Streets Have No Name " was released instead , in August 1987 
 The single was released on 7 @-@ inch , 12 @-@ inch , cassette and CD single formats 
 Three B @-@ sides were featured on the single , including " Race Against Time " , " Silver and Gold " , and " <unk> Thing " , except for the 7 @-@ inch release , which only featured the latter two tracks 
 The 12 @-@ inch single featured " Race Against Time " on side A of the record ( despite being a " B @-@ side " ) , and the cassette single featured all four tracks on both sides of the tape 
 Although not as successful as the album 's first two singles , the song did chart well 
 In the U
S
 , the song peaked at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 11 on the Album Rock Tracks charts 
 The song reached number four on the UK Singles Chart , and it topped the Irish Singles Chart 
The video begins with an aerial shot of a block in Los Angeles , and clips of radio broadcasts are heard with disc <unk> stating that U2 is planning on performing a concert downtown and expecting crowds of 30 @,@ 000 people 
 Police show up to the set and inform the band 's crew of the security issue that the film shoot is causing , due to the large number of people who are coming to watch the performance 
 Two minutes into the video , U2 are seen on the roof of a liquor store at the corner of 7th <unk> and S
 Main St
 , and perform " Where the Streets Have No Name " to a large crowd of people standing in the streets surrounding the building 
 Towards the end of the song , the police tell the crew that the performance is about to be shut down , and eventually police walk onto the roof while the crowd are <unk> the police 
The depiction of the police attempting to shut down the video shoot due to safety concerns actually happened during filming , just as seen in the video 
 <unk> was almost arrested following a confrontation with the police 
 According to Avis , the events depicted in the video show what actually happened that day " almost in real time " , and that " getting <unk> was an integral part of the plan 
 " Band manager Paul McGuinness revealed in 2007 that much of the confrontation with the police was exaggerated ; the group were hoping to get shut down by the authorities in order to <unk> the music video , but the police continually gave them extensions for shooting the video 
 In the background of the video is a sign for The Million Dollar Hotel , which was rebuilt to create some interest , in case no one showed up at the film shoot 
 Although the video is of a live performance , the audio used is from the studio @-@ recorded version of the song 
 The video won the Grammy Award for Best Performance Music Video at the 1989 Grammy Awards 
" Race Against Time " was released on the 12 @-@ inch , cassette , and CD versions of the single 
 The song developed from the band 's interest in urban funk , and was described by The Edge as " a kind of Afro @-@ rhythmic piece " and " a study in rhythm 
 " The bass riff in the song , inspired by the <unk> , was played by The Edge , but stemmed from some of Clayton 's unused bass parts 
 Mullen 's drum part was recorded in a single take 
 The song is primarily an instrumental piece but does contain some lyrics inspired by Bono 's trip to Ethiopia after Live Aid and his witnessing firsthand the famine in occurrence ; these lyrical references include Bono singing in an Ethiopian language and following it with the phrase " Race against time " 
 Bono said of the song , " It reminds me of the desert 
 The desert is so empty , but it <unk> with a strange kind of <unk> 
 " John Hutchinson of Musician magazine described the song as having an " African flavour " and as being reminiscent of Peter Gabriel 
 The track was used in the Miami Vice episode " Child 's Play " , and is the only one of the single 's B @-@ sides that was never played live 
" Silver and Gold " was written in support of the Artists United Against <unk> project , which protested the South African apartheid 
 In 1985 , Bono participated in Steven Van <unk> 's anti @-@ apartheid Sun City project and spent time with Keith Richards and Mick Jagger of The Rolling Stones 
 When Richards and Jagger played blues , Bono was embarrassed by his lack of familiarity with the genre , as most of U2 's musical knowledge began with punk rock in their youth in the mid @-@ 1970s 
 Bono realised that U2 " had no tradition " , and he felt as if they " were from outer space " 
 This inspired him to write the blues @-@ influenced song " Silver and Gold " , which he recorded with Richards and Ronnie Wood 
 It was re @-@ recorded by U2 for the " Where the Streets Have No Name " single while the band returned to Dublin during in May 1987 during a break between the first and second legs of The Joshua Tree Tour 
 The song was described by Musician as " tough and raw , with Bono in <unk> and confident voice , <unk> by a <unk> bass line , and with The Edge demonstrating his newfound prowess in blues @-@ based guitar 
 " " Silver and Gold " was played live on The Joshua Tree Tour several times , one performance of which was featured on the band 's 1988 album and <unk> , Rattle and Hum 
 Both the studio recording and the Sun City versions were later featured on the bonus disc of the 20th anniversary edition of The Joshua Tree 
 The studio version was also included on the limited edition B @-@ sides bonus disk of the band 's first compilation album , The Best of 1980 – 1990 
" <unk> Thing " was written by Bono as an apology to his wife for forgetting her birthday 
 The song opens with a short piano piece before the rest of the band begins to play 
 Some of Bono 's lyrics have been described as reminiscent of John Lennon 
 The Edge described it as " a beautiful song 


 which is pop as it should be — not produced out of existence , but pop produced with a real intimacy and purity " , also noting that " It 's very new for us 
 " It was re @-@ recorded with some lyrical alterations and released in 1998 as a single in its own right for The Best of 1980 – 1990 
 Hot Press editor Niall Stokes stated that this track , along with " Race Against Time " , is " an indicator of what U2 might have made instead of The Joshua Tree 
Upon the release of The Joshua Tree , critics praised " Where the Streets Have No Name " 
 Steve <unk> of The Boston Globe noted the " bell @-@ like tones from the Edge <unk> [ e ] a search for heaven " and along with the subsequent track on the album , " I Still Haven 't Found What I 'm Looking For " , these songs showed how the group were " pilgrims still on a quest ; not preachers who claim to have found answers " 
 The Bergen Record echoed these sentiments , saying the tracks demonstrated how the band was on a personal and spiritual quest 
 Rolling Stone called it " assertive rock " in their review of The Joshua Tree 
 The San Diego Union @-@ Tribune said of " Where the Streets Have No Name " , " the music charges , like someone fleeing for life " 
 The Washington Post said the track is " a bit oblique lyrically , but the implications are clear in Bono 's resolute delivery , Dave ( the Edge ) Evan 's <unk> guitar , Adam Clayton 's cathedral bass and Larry Mullen 's rolling thunder drums " 
NME lauded the song as the opening track by saying the album " starts by spitting furiously " 
 The publication praised Bono 's impassioned singing and The Edge 's guitar playing , which transformed the instrument into " something more than an <unk> abused piece of wood " 
 The review commented that the " last ten seconds are <unk> beautiful " 
 The Rocket wrote that the song builds a " wall of sound " that Bono 's vocals cut through with a " <unk> of <unk> , as the lyrics <unk> the need for personal spirituality " 
 The reviewer compared the opening riff to <unk> <unk> ' " <unk> " 
 Reviewing The Joshua Tree , Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called the song an " epic opener " 
 The service 's Steve Huey , in a review of the song , praised its " <unk> , propulsive rhythmic drive and <unk> chorus " , qualities he singled out for making it a fan favorite 
 He called the song the " perfect album @-@ opener " , <unk> the " slow build of its arrangement toward a climactic peak " 
 Huey also called Bono 's delivery " passionate and grandiose " and " his commitment to the material <unk> " 
 He believed the combination of his vocals and the band 's " sonic power " is what gave U2 its " tremendous force " 
" Where the Streets Have No Name " made its concert debut on 2 April 1987 in <unk> , Arizona on the opening night of The Joshua Tree Tour 
 It has since been played at nearly every full @-@ length concert that U2 has <unk> , totaling over 700 performances as of 2011 
 The song is widely regarded as one of the group 's most popular live songs 
 Bono said of it , " We can be in the middle of the worst gig in our lives , but when we go into that song , everything changes 
 The audience is on its feet , singing along with every word 
 It 's like God suddenly walks through the room 
On The Joshua Tree Tour , " Where the Streets Have No Name " was most often used to open concerts 
 Fans and critics responded favourably to the song in a live setting 
 The San Diego Union @-@ Tribune wrote that , " From the <unk> sonic opening strains of [ the song ] , this audience was up , <unk> and <unk> 
 " NME wrote that the song is one such occasion where " the power afforded their songs is scary " , noting that during the song 's opening , " the arena <unk> " 
 In other reviews , the song was called : " <unk> " , " <unk> " , and " powerful " 
 Out of the 109 shows during The Joshua Tree Tour , " Streets " was played at all except 12 of the concerts 
 During the <unk> Tour which took place in 1989 and the beginning of 1990 , " Streets " was only left out of the set list at one of the 47 concerts 
The song was performed at every show on the 1992 – 1993 Zoo TV Tour 
 Concerts from this tour were elaborate <unk> <unk> that Bono performed as a variety of characters , but for the end of the main set , the group reverted to playing classics , including " Where the Streets Have No Name " , straight 
 Some of these performances of the song were accompanied by footage of the group in the desert from The Joshua Tree 's photo shoot 
 The video was <unk> up for humorous effect — NME described the effect as giving it a " silly , Charlie <unk> quality " — and Bono often acknowledged his younger self on the video screens 
 This video would make a return during performances on the 2010 and 2011 legs of the U2 360 ° Tour 
 Some of the Zoo TV performances of the song had a more electronic dance music arrangement that bore a resemblance to the Pet Shop Boys ' synthpop cover of the song ( titled " Where the Streets Have No Name ( I Can 't Take My Eyes off You ) " ) 
 Bono parodied this by occasionally adopting the deadpan vocal style used in the Pet Shop Boys ' cover 
 Critics welcomed the song in the group 's setlist : The Independent said the song " <unk> instant euphoria , as U2 do what they 're best at , slipping into epic rock mode , playing music made for the arena " 
 In two other local newspaper reviews , critics praised the song 's inclusion in a sequence of greatest hits 
Shortly before the third leg of the <unk> Tour , the September 11 attacks occurred in New York City and Washington D
C
 During the band 's first show in New York City following the attacks , the band performed " Where the Streets Have No Name " , and when the stage lights illuminated the audience , the band saw tears streaming down the faces of many fans 
 The experience was one inspiration for the song " City of <unk> Lights " 
 The band paid tribute to the 9 / 11 victims during their performance of the song at the Super Bowl <unk> halftime show on 3 February 2002 
 The performance featured the names of the September 11 victims projected onto a large white banner behind the band 
 U2 's appearance was later ranked number 1 on Sports Illustrated 's list of " Top 10 Super Bowl <unk> <unk> " 
For the Vertigo Tour , the group originally considered dropping the song from their <unk> , but Mullen and Clayton successfully argued against this 
 All 131 of the Vertigo Tour concerts featured a performance of the song , which were accompanied by the stage 's LED video <unk> displaying African flags 
 On the tour 's opening night , this reminded Bono that he had originally written the lyrics in an Ethiopian village 
 He thought this visual accompaniment made the song come full circle , saying , " And here it was , nearly twenty years later , coming back to Africa , all the stuff about <unk> lands and <unk> making sense for the first time 
 " The song was also played at the preview screening of the band 's concert film U2 3D at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival 
 At the Glastonbury Festival 2010 , The Edge accompanied rock band <unk> for a live cover version of the track , later playing it with U2 while headlining Glastonbury in 2011

 The 2004 digital album , Live from the Point Depot , contains a performance from the <unk> Tour , only available as part of The Complete U2 digital box set 
In 2002 , Q magazine named " Where the Streets Have No Name " the <unk> " most exciting tune ever "
